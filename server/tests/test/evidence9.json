{"evidenceData": "The contract stipulated delivery of 5 modules by 01/09/2025.  Module 1 and 2 were delivered on time, while Module 3 was delayed by 3 days, and Modules 4 and 5 had minor bugs fixed immediately after reporting.  The client initially threatened to withhold payment, citing delays, but later confirmed in writing that all modules met the required specifications.  Some internal emails from the client expressed dissatisfaction, while external communications praised timely responses.  Overall, there was no material financial loss, and the client accepted the final deliverables.  Despite minor delays, the contractor fulfilled obligations, but procedural breaches were noted in internal documentation."}
