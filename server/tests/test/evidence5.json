{"evidenceData": "The supplier failed to deliver the contracted software modules on time. Even after two extensions, 40% of the features were either missing or malfunctioning. The client provided detailed feedback and requested corrections, but the supplier responded late and partially implemented the fixes. The delays caused the client to miss internal deadlines, resulting in financial loss. All communications indicate negligence on the supplier's part."}
