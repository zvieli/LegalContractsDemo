{"evidenceData": "The dispute concerns a service contract where both parties claim partial completion of tasks. The client provides screenshots indicating late responses, while the contractor provides logs showing on-time completion. Some tasks are documented inconsistently, and emails contradict verbal agreements. It is unclear which party breached the contract terms first. No definitive evidence favors either side."}
