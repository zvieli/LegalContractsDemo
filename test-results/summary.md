E2E + TESTING run summary

Date: 2025-10-01

Results:
- Full test run with TESTING=1: 107 passing
- Playwright e2e: No tests found (front folder has no Playwright tests configured to run)

Important TESTING log markers extracted:
- Lines with TESTING_DECRYPT_START / TESTING_ECIES_* show crypto helper exercised and both CLI and client decrypt flows exercised.
- Evidence endpoint started multiple times on port 5001 during tests.

Artifacts:
- Full console output: `test-results/testing-full.log`

Next steps:
1. If you want the Playwright UI coverage, add Playwright tests under `front/tests/e2e` or enable `front/e2e` runner.
2. Add `test-results/testing-full.log` as an artifact to CI and gate deploys on passing tests if desired.
