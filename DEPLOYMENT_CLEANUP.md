# Deployment Scripts Cleanup - October 2025

## Summary
Consolidated multiple deployment scripts into a single, unified `deploy.js` for better maintainability and user experience.

## Changes Made

### Files Removed
- ✅ `deploy-unified.js` - Identical to current `deploy.js`, removed duplicate
- ✅ `deploy-clean.js` - Legacy deployment script, functionality merged into `deploy.js`
- ✅ `deploy-merkle-evidence.js` - Standalone Merkle evidence deployment, merged into `deploy.js`

### Files Archived
- ✅ `deploy.js.backup` → `archive/deploy.js.v6-original` - Original V6 deployment script preserved

### Files Retained
- ✅ `deploy.js` - Unified deployment script with all functionality

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One deployment script handles all infrastructure
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to choose between multiple deployment options
3. **Better Testing**: Single script is easier to test and maintain
4. **Complete Feature Set**: Includes all V7 features including Merkle Evidence system

## Functionality Included in Unified deploy.js

- ✅ Core infrastructure deployment (Factory, ArbitrationService, KeyRegistry, Arbitrator)
- ✅ Merkle Evidence Manager deployment and configuration
- ✅ Automatic contract wiring and permissions setup
- ✅ Chainlink price feed configuration
- ✅ Frontend ABI copying and configuration file generation
- ✅ Gas optimization testing (82% savings demonstration)
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment validation

## Usage

```bash
# Local deployment
npm run deploy:localhost

# Other networks
npm run deploy:sepolia
npm run deploy:mainnet

# Direct usage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
```

## Gas Efficiency Demonstrated

The unified script shows real gas savings:
- Traditional evidence: ~79,000 gas each
- Batch submission: ~140,000 gas for unlimited items
- **Savings: Up to 96% for large batches**

## Validation

- ✅ All Merkle Evidence tests pass (6/6 tests)
- ✅ 17 ABI files copied correctly
- ✅ Frontend configuration files generated
- ✅ Complete deployment takes ~6 seconds
- ✅ All contracts properly wired and configured
