As to\n\nthe latter claim, he asserts there was no nexus established between his identified\n\nparental deficiency and his ability to safely parent. We disagree and affirm.\n\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n       L.C.C.-H. was born July 28, 2019 to mother M.C. and father R.H. At the\n\ntime of her birth, L was diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome, and M.C.\n\nadmitted to using methamphetamine and heroin during pregnancy. L was released\n\nfrom the hospital to M.C.’s sister pursuant to a one-month voluntary placement\n\nagreement. The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) filed a\n\ndependency petition on August 30, 2019.\n\n       The court held a shelter care hearing on September 9. M.C. entered an\n\nagreed order for shelter care. R.H. contested the need for shelter care, and the\n\fNo. 86140-9-I/2\n\n\ntrial court agreed to place L with him subject to several conditions, including three\n\nmonths of twice monthly random urinalysis (UA). The court ordered that if any of\n\nthe UAs were positive for illegal drugs or nonprescription controlled substances, L\n\nwould not be immediately removed from her father, but R.H. would be required to\n\ncomplete a substance use disorder (SUD) evaluation.           M.C. was allowed a\n\nminimum of three two-hour supervised visits each week. R.H. was not permitted\n\nto supervise M.C.’s visits, nor was the she permitted to live with him.\n\n       On November 4, the Des Moines Police Department placed L in protective\n\ncustody after discovering R.H. and L in a home, not their residence, “that was\n\ndeemed to be unsafe and where drug paraphernalia was found by the police.”\n\nAccording to officers on the scene, R.H. hid with L when law enforcement arrived.\n\nM.C. was found in the same home, although R.H. denied that he knew she was\n\nthere and asserted that L did not have contact with her mother that day. R.H.\n\nstated he was there because the resident of the home was assisting him with car\n\nrepairs. L was temporarily placed with her maternal grandparents before being\n\nreturned to R.H.’s care on November 7.\n\n       After this incident, DCYF filed a motion for emergency removal of L from\n\nher father’s care. In its order on the motion, the court found there was “a valid\n\nsafety risk that certifies this motion as an emergency” but denied it nonetheless.\n\nThe court allowed L to remain with her father with additional conditions of\n\nplacement and requirements to complete services. Among the new obligations,\n\nthe court ordered R.H. to provide one random UA each week and comply with the\n\nconditions set out in the shelter care order. R.H. had negative UAs on November\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fNo. 86140-9-I/3\n\n\n7, December 5, December 20, and January 6, 2020. He also missed some\n\nscheduled UAs during those same months.\n\n       On January 10, 2020, the trial court denied DCYF’s renewed motion to\n\nremove L from her father’s care. The court ordered that R.H. complete a SUD\n\nassessment by the end of January and engage in the recommended treatment\n\nplan within 30 days. The court also ordered a hair follicle test for any “illegal\n\nsubstances” but specified that a positive test “will not on its own warrant removal.”\n\nR.H. completed a hair follicle test which was positive for amphetamine,\n\nmethamphetamine, morphine, codeine, and heroin. He failed to complete a SUD\n\nassessment as ordered.\n\n       The court appointed special advocate (CASA) filed an emergency motion\n\nfor L’s removal on January 27 due to concerns about her safety and R.H.’s lack of\n\ncompliance with the court ordered conditions. According to the testimony of the\n\nDCYF social worker, they had not been able to contact R.H. consistently in order\n\nto schedule a health and safety visit. The CASA was apprehensive about L’s living\n\nsituation with R.H., as her whereabouts were unknown, and R.H.’s continued\n\nsubstance use. The trial court continued the hearing on the motion, maintained\n\nplacement with R.H., ordered that he report his whereabouts for the time he was\n\nnot at his approved residence and complete two UAs that week. The court also\n\nordered that L undergo drug testing. L’s test results were negative for illegal\n\nsubstances.    On January 28, R.H. submitted a UA that was positive for\n\nmethamphetamine and opiates.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fNo. 86140-9-I/4\n\n\n          On February 2, the court removed L from her father’s care and placed her\n\nwith a paternal aunt. The court entered an agreed order of dependency as to R.H.\n\non February 28. 1 The order of dependency noted that he agreed in order to\n\n“provide court structure over the family” and to access services. At that time, the\n\ncourt also entered a dispositional order which required R.H. to complete random\n\nUAs once per week for 90 days and undergo a SUD assessment and follow all\n\ntreatment recommendations. He was also ordered to engage in the “Promoting\n\nFirst Relationships” class which he had already started. 2\n\n          At some point, after L’s removal from his care, R.H. lost his housing. 3 DCYF\n\nregularly attempted contact and sent service letters and e-mails to both parents.\n\nDespite DCYF efforts to meet in person, the parents “rarely responded to meeting\n\nrequests” and most meetings occurred “when offering direct assistance, such as\n\ngas gift cards or vouchers.”\n\n          DCYF offered and referred SUD services to both parents, including\n\nassessments and UAs. R.H. completed a SUD evaluation on September 30, 2020,\n\nwhich resulted in a diagnosis of moderate opioid use disorder and “Other Stimulant\n\nUse Disorder.”          The assessment recommended that he complete level 2.1\n\nintensive outpatient treatment. R.H. began attending level 1 SUD treatment at a\n\ndifferent facility in September 2021. A progress report from the facility prepared in\n\nearly October 2021 noted that of the ten sessions scheduled in September, he\n\n\n          1 M.C. entered an agreed order of dependency on June 22, 2020.      She is not a party to this\nappeal.\n          2 The record indicates that R.H. completed Promoting First Relationships by December\n\n2020.\n          3 R.H testified that he lost his housing shortly after L was removed from his care in February\n\n2020. However, he also explained that he had received housing assistance for some time, but had\nbeen homeless again for roughly a year prior to the termination trial.\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fNo. 86140-9-I/5\n\n\nattended five but also had five absences, four of which were unexcused. He was\n\nnot in compliance with either group session attendance or the requisite UAs, and\n\nhis progress was considered “not satisfactory.” R.H. continued to have sporadic\n\nattendance and his progress was also reported as “not satisfactory” through\n\nOctober, November, and December 2021. In April 2022, he was discharged from\n\nSUD treatment “due to no contact with individual counselor since December 2021.”\n\nAlso in 2022, R.H. scheduled two separate appointments for an updated SUD\n\nevaluation but failed to attend either one.\n\n       R.H. consistently visited with L from the time of her removal from his care\n\nuntil she was placed with a relative in Kennewick, Washington on August 1, 2021.\n\nAt that time, the court established in person visitation at a minimum of once a week\n\nfor five hours. The visits were to alternate between "}

(LMI) appeals the trial\n\ncourt’s order that confirmed an arbitration award in favor of Yuan’s Management\n\nInvestment Inc. (YMI) and its manager Gang Yuan (collectively Yuan Claimants). 1\n\nBecause none of the statutory exceptions under RCW 7.04A.230 and .240 for\n\nvacating, correcting or modifying the arbitration award apply, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s order that confirmed the award and grant the Yuan Claimants their attorney\n\nfees and costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n        1 LMI brings this appeal against Yuan’s H&H Property LLC, L&Y Real Estate Development\n\nLLC, Yuan’s Management Investment Inc., and Gang Yuan. However, the underlying arbitration\nwas between the members of those LLCs, including Yuan and YMI, not the LLCs themselves.\nFurthermore, the arbitration award was issued against LMI and its co-party, Jiayi Peng. She is not\nnamed as an appellant in this appeal.\n       In the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator referred to Yuan and YMI collectively as the\n“Yuan Claimants” and Jiayi Peng and LMI as the “Lu Claimants.” For the sake of clarity, we adopt\nthe same language in this appeal.\n\fNo. 87179-0-I/2\n\n\n                                            FACTS 2\n\n        In February 2016, Gang Yuan, 3 citizen and resident of Chongqing, China,\n\nformed Yuan’s H&H Property LLC (H&H), a Washington limited liability company\n\n(LLC). The members of H&H are two other Washington LLCs, YMI and LMI. YMI,\n\nwhich owns 45 percent of H&H, is owned by a trust established for the benefit of\n\nYuan’s daughter. Yuan serves as the trustee. LMI, which holds the remaining 55\n\npercent of H&H, is owned by a trust for Jiayi Peng. Shu Lu, Jiayi’s mother, serves\n\nas its trustee. 4\n\n        Yuan also incorporated L&Y Real Estate Development LLC (L&Y), another\n\nWashington LLC. Yuan owns 45 percent of L&Y and Jiayi owns 55 percent. Both\n\nH&H and L&Y operate under LLC agreements that name Yuan as the sole\n\nmanager.\n\n        Yuan’s investment strategy for H&H, which was determined in 2015, was to\n\nacquire properties near the University of Washington (U District), demolish the\n\nexisting structures, and construct student housing (Seattle project). 5 In March\n\n2016, acting on behalf of H&H, Yuan contracted to buy two adjoining lots in the U\n\nDistrict.\n\n        Shortly thereafter, Yuan returned to Chongqing and informed Jian Hua Lu,\n\nJiayi’s grandfather and the general manager of two Chinese real estate\n\n\n        2 Additional facts will be set out in each section as necessary for analysis of the various\n\nassignments of error.\n        3 Yuan and Jian Hua Lu are the primary litigants. For clarity, we refer to them by their\n\nfamily names throughout the opinion. Many others involved are relatives with shared family names,\nand we refer to them by their first names. No disrespect is intended.\n        4 Jiayi and Shu are also citizens and residents of Chongqing, China.\n        5 The arbitrator referred to the area near the University of Washington as the “U District”\n\nand H&H’s investment as the “Seattle Project.” Again, for the sake of clarity by tracking with the\nrecord on appeal, we adopt this language.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 87179-0-I/3\n\n\ncompanies, Chongqing Qinglong House Industry Development Co. Ltd. (Qinglong)\n\nand Chongqing Zhongcheng Property Development Co. Ltd. (CZPD), about the\n\nSeattle project. Yuan’s advertising company, Dingrun Cultural Media Ltd., later re-\n\nnamed Dingying Cultural Media Ltd., had previously worked with Lu in the early\n\n2000s. Lu expressed interest in joining the venture to secure assets in the United\n\nStates for Jiayi, following the imprisonment of her father, Zhimin Peng, who had\n\nfounded Qinglong and CZPD.\n\n      Lu and Yuan agreed that Yuan would transfer Lu’s funds to the United\n\nStates and manage the daily activities of the Seattle project. Between April 2016\n\nand November 2018, Lu transferred approximately 65.6 million RMB 6 (around\n\n$9.46 million at the time) to Yuan for the project. Yuan also contributed about $8.5\n\nmillion to the LLCs from his own financial sources.\n\n      In 2016, H&H ultimately purchased three lots near the U District, but later\n\nabandoned development. Those properties remain H&H’s only asset. In May\n\n2017, H&H purchased a fourth property on Rose Point Lane on the waterfront in\n\nKirkland (Rose Point Property) for $3.15 million. Yuan envisioned purchasing the\n\nlot adjacent to Rose Point, demolishing the houses on both lots, and building new\n\nhomes to sell or rent. After purchasing the Rose Point Property, Yuan was unable\n\nto persuade the adjacent owner to sell. Shu was not interested in keeping just the\n\nRose Point Property as an H&H investment without the adjacent land to develop.\n\nYuan then personally bought the Rose Point Property from H&H and transferred\n\nthe title to YMI in March 2018. As a result of the title transfer, Yuan directed the\n\n\n\n      6 Renminbi, abbreviated to “RMB,” is the official currency of the People’s Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fNo. 87179-0-I/4\n\n\naccountant for H&H and L&Y to reduce YMI’s capital account in H&H by more than\n\nthe $3.15 million purchase price of the property.\n\n        In 2021, both the Yuan and Lu families independently decided to end their\n\ninvolvement in the Seattle project. They agreed to sell H&H’s properties and\n\ndissolve both H&H and L&Y. However, disputes arose about how to distribute\n\ndissolution proceeds. In November 2021, LMI and Jiayi, holding a 55 percent\n\nstake in both LLCs, notified Yuan of their intent to remove him as manager. The\n\nparties attempted to mediate these issues, but LMI and Jiayi eventually opted to\n\npursue arbitration.\n\n        The LLC agreements of H&H and L&Y included binding arbitration clauses,\n\nwhich provided that “[a]ll disputes among the parties arising out of or related to this\n\nAgreement which have not been settled by mediation shall be resolved by binding\n\narbitration within the State of Washington.” They also included identical governing\n\nlaw provisions, which stated,\n\n        This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in\n        accordance with the internal laws of the state of Washington, without\n        giving effect to principles and provisions thereof relating to conflict or\n        choice of laws, irrespective of the fact that any one of the parties is\n        now or may become a resident of a different state. Venue for any\n        action under this Agreement shall lie in King County, Washington.\n\nOn March 23, 2022, both sides served arbitration demands on each other. They\n\njointly selected and agreed on the individual to serve as the sole arbitrator. The\n\narbitration addressed Yuan’s removal as manager, the LLCs’ accounting,\n\ndistribution, and the dissolution process. A 12-day hearing took place in January\n\n2024.     Fourteen witnesses testified, including Yuan, Lu family members,\n\naccountants from both the United States and China, and expert witnesses. The\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fNo. 87179-0-I/5\n\n\narbitrator also considered testimony from six deposition transcripts and over 200\n\nexhibits.\n\n       As manager, Yuan spent extended periods of time in Seattle from 2016 until\n\nlate 2021. He assembled the local project team, managed real estate acquisitions,\n\noversaw development efforts, and controlled H&H and L&Y’s finances. Yuan\n\nmade more than 10 unreimbursed trips to Seattle to work on the development\n\neffort. He also introduced e"}

We affirm his conviction, but reverse in part and remand to\n\namend the condition and strike the legal financial obligations.\n\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n       In January 2020, Gebremariam worked as a driver for King County Metro,\n\ndriving for the Access program, which provides transportation services to people\n\nwith disabilities. K.T. routinely used this program for trips to her job in childcare.\n\nK.T. was 36 years old at the time, but was alleged to have the cognitive\n\fNo. 85179-9-I/2\n\n\ndevelopment of a 12- to 14-year-old. 1 On January 6, Gebremariam picked up K.T.\n\nfrom her adult group home to take her to work. K.T. said that when she boarded\n\nthe bus on the date in question, Gebremariam asked her for a hug, repeatedly said\n\n“peekaboo” to her, and asked her to be his girlfriend.\n\n        Gebremariam dropped off another Access passenger, but made a detour\n\ninstead of taking K.T. directly to work and made a comment about them having\n\nsex. 2 He pulled off the road and into a parking lot, then walked back to where K.T.\n\nwas sitting and started talking to her.              K.T. would later tell detectives that\n\nGebremariam had told her she had on “a low cut shirt.” K.T. alleged he kissed her\n\nand touched her chest with one finger, under her shirt and over her bra. She\n\ntestified that Gebremariam asked if she wanted to “feel” his body, then took her\n\nhand, placed it on his crotch, and moved her hand up and down. While doing this\n\nhe told her, “It’s ok, no one can see. No one will tell.” K.T. insisted that the delay\n\nwould make her late to work, so Gebremariam stopped, returned to the front of the\n\nbus, and took her to work after telling her that he was “just kidding.”\n\n        K.T. did not report the incident upon arriving at work, but when she returned\n\nhome, she called her mother, R., and told her what had happened. R. later testified\n\nthat K.T. sounded “hyperactive” and “like she was going to cry” as she described\n\nwhat had happened on the bus. R. also told K.T. to write down everything she\n\n\n\n        1 The State readily admitted it would not present expert testimony regarding the exact\n\nnature and implications of K.T.’s condition and it is not evidenced in the record beyond the\ntestimony of her mother, R.\n         Because they share the last name, and out of respect for K.T.’s privacy, we use initials to\nrefer to her parents as well.\n         2 The other passenger was not questioned by law enforcement and did not testify at trial.\n\nThe caretaker for that passenger had stated to Detective Alan Garrison that she was “almost non\ncommunicative.”\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 85179-9-I/3\n\n\ncould remember about what had happened. K.T. discussed the incident with her\n\nroommate, Laura, 3 and the woman running the home, Christina Nhet, overheard\n\nthem. Nhet later testified that after coming home, K.T. “was crying” on the phone\n\nand, when asked what was the matter, told Nhet that “on her way to work, the bus\n\ndriver tried to kiss her and put his hand into her bra.”\n\n       King County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) Deputy Matt Wynkoop responded to\n\nthe initial call and spoke to K.T.’s father, G. Wynkoop did not speak to K.T., but\n\ndid collect the notes she had made on January 6. KCSO Detectives Alan Garrison\n\nand Christine Parks met with K.T. and her parents in their home in late January.\n\nGarrison contacted Gebremariam after the interview with K.T. and Gebremariam\n\nmet with Garrison at his office.           Gebremariam told Garrison that the van’s\n\nnavigation system had not provided a correct route between stops and he had\n\npulled into the parking lot because of a concerning smell that Gebremariam\n\nthought might be the tires. Gebremariam denied that any sexual conversations or\n\ninappropriate touching had occurred.             Garrison also spoke to Gebremariam’s\n\nsupervisors who were able to corroborate the route Gebremariam had taken that\n\nday based on stored data. The Access van did not have inward facing cameras,\n\nso the alleged incident was not caught on video.\n\n       The State charged Gebremariam with one count of indecent liberties and\n\nspecifically alleged that he committed the offense against a developmentally\n\ndisabled person, as defined by RCW 71A.10.020, while he “[w]as providing\n\n\n\n\n       3 Laura’s last name is not present in the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fNo. 85179-9-I/4\n\n\ntransportation, within the course of [his] employment, to the victim.” 4 In its motions\n\nin limine, the State sought admission of another interaction between K.T. and\n\nGebremariam, purported to have occurred about a month prior to the charged\n\nincident. The State asserted that while Gebremariam was driving K.T. to work, he\n\nhad stopped in another parking lot, played peekaboo with K.T., and touched her\n\nknee. The State offered this prior act under ER 404(b) as evidence of a common\n\nplan and opportunity or, alternatively, as res gestae. Gebremariam objected and\n\nargued that the State had provided an inaccurate statement of the law regarding\n\nthe requirements for admitting other act evidence.                   The trial judge ultimately\n\nadmitted the prior incident after hearing testimony from K.T. outside the presence\n\nof the jury and entering findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n        At trial, the jury heard testimony from K.T., R., Wynkoop, and Garrison, as\n\nwell as people who oversaw aspects of the Access program. The defense sought\n\nto impeach K.T. and R. by eliciting testimony from R. that the family had filed a civil\n\nsuit for negligence against King County, seeking $1 to $2 million in damages. The\n\njury convicted Gebremariam as charged.\n\n        Gebremariam timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n        4 Indecent liberties is an alternate means crime.       Here, the State charged Gebremariam\nunder RCW 9A.44.100(1)(c)(ii), which specifically relies on the definition of developmental disability\nset out in RCW 71A.10.020. That statute establishes that\n         “[d]evelopmental disability” means a disability attributable to intellectual disability,\n         cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, or another neurological or other condition of an\n         individual found by the secretary to be closely related to an intellectual disability or\n         to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with intellectual\n         disabilities, which disability originates before the individual attains age eighteen,\n         which has continued or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and which\n         constitutes a substantial limitation to the individual.\nRCW 71A.10.020(6).\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 85179-9-I/5\n\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\nI.

Andersen challenges his rape conviction for lack of sufficient\n\nevidence that J.E.F. was incapable of consent and as a violation of double jeopardy. We\n\nconclude there was no error and affirm his conviction.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       On September 8, 2022, J.E.F. went to his neighbor John Andersen’s residence, a\n\nrecreational vehicle (RV), to play cards. J.E.F. brought four beers to Andersen’s RV\n\nand, while there, consumed about three beers and several shots of hard liquor. At that\n\ntime, J.E.F. was taking the drug gabapentin for a recent surgery. J.E.F. and Andersen\n\nplayed about two card games before J.E.F. started to not feel well and decided to go\n\nhome. J.E.F. reported that he was losing his “motor skills,” and his card shuffles were\n\n“very lumpy shuffles rather than real smooth like [he’s] used to.” J.E.F. testified that he\n\nwas “stumbling” as he was leaving Andersen’s residence and that he was “not sure if\n\fNo. 86089-5-I/2\n\n\n[he] was pushed or not” but that he “hit the ground” somewhere outside the front of\n\nAndersen’s RV.\n\n       J.E.F. testified that he remembered Andersen “lifting [him] up by the waist and\n\npulling [his] pants down,” and that he yelled “stop, get off, what are you doing,” and that\n\nhe tried to crawl away but could not stand up. J.E.F. stated that after Andersen pulled\n\nhis pants down, he remembered that he “was violated with the pipe,” meaning the pipe\n\nwas inserted into his anus. He stated that he was aware that the pipe was inside his\n\nanus because he was “able to glance over [his] shoulder, see [Andersen] holding it, and\n\n[Andersen] had this strange look on his face and he was laughing and giggling,” and\n\nwhen asked who was holding the pipe, J.E.F. identified Andersen. J.E.F. described the\n\npipe as gray and “two to three feet” in length. J.E.F. further testified that while the pipe\n\nwas being inserted into his anus he “was losing consciousness,” which he described as\n\n“one minute, [he] was engaged in the moment and knew it was going on, and then when\n\n[he] next became aware of the situation, things would be different as in [he] would be in\n\na different place in the yard [and] was turned and stuff.” J.E.F. testified that he\n\nattempted to scream but he could not physically leave.\n\n       J.E.F. explained that he regained consciousness behind a picnic table near\n\nAndersen’s RV and was aware that his pants were still off but could not recall if any\n\nother objects had been inserted into his anus. J.E.F. again lost consciousness, and\n\nwhen he regained consciousness, he was closer to the RV and noticed that his whole\n\nbody was wet and his pants, phone, and wallet were spread across the yard. J.E.F.\n\ntestified that he was then able to crawl to his residence on his belly, before collapsing\n\non the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 86089-5-I/3\n\n\n        J.E.F. stated that his body felt destroyed and that he had “aches and pains, and\n\nfelt [he] had been beat, and of course, [his] rear hurt something fierce, and [he] was\n\nbleeding” from his anus. He collapsed on the floor and fell asleep. After waking up, he\n\nwas able to “sit on the toilet and bleed and wipe [himself] off head to toe with a\n\nwashcloth.” He explained that he made it through the first night, September 9, but that\n\nthe next morning “it became obvious [ ] that [he] need[ed] some help,” meaning medical\n\nattention. J.E.F. attributed his delay in seeking medical attention to “denial, shock, [and]\n\ndisbelief.” J.E.F. contacted emergency services to report that he was raped and was\n\ntaken to EvergreenHealth hospital in Monroe. Officers from the Monroe Police\n\nDepartment (MPD) also responded to EvergreenHealth to meet with J.E.F. and to\n\ndocument his injuries.\n\n        Dr. Stephen Gardner, an emergency room physician at EvergreenHealth, treated\n\nJ.E.F. on September 11. Dr. Gardner reported that J.E.F. had “a rectal perforation, he\n\nhad pneumoperitoneum and pneumomediastinum and multiple healing abrasions.”\n\nDr. Gardner explained that pneumoperitoneum is abnormal air in the abdominal cavity\n\nand pneumomediastinum is abnormal air in the chest cavity. He further testified that\n\nJ.E.F.’s bladder was swollen. Dr. Gardner explained that J.E.F.’s injuries were\n\nconsistent with a “foreign body inserted into the rectum” with significant force.\n\nDr. Gardner stated that in particular, the rectal perforation was not a very common injury\n\nand was concerning because it meant that “his bowels and stool [were] essentially\n\nflowing into his abdomen, which [would] cause infection which could be life-threatening,”\n\nand would require treatment by a colorectal surgeon or specialized trauma surgeon at a\n\ndifferent facility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 86089-5-I/4\n\n\n        J.E.F. was transferred to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he was\n\ntreated by Dr. Erik Van Eaton. Dr. Van Eaton surgically placed a colostomy bag in\n\nJ.E.F. and later discovered that he had a bladder injury, which required the surgical\n\nplacement of a urinary catheter. 1 J.E.F. remained in the hospital for 10 days. At\n\nHarborview, J.E.F. also underwent an exam conducted by a sexual assault nurse\n\nexaminer (SANE) sometime between September 13 and 14. 2\n\n        On September 11, an MPD officer took Andersen into custody and he consented\n\nto an interview. Subsequently, a search warrant was issued for Andersen’s residence.\n\nSeveral items were collected, including a large wooden dowel, a small wooden dowel,\n\nand a gray plastic pipe. The evidence taken from Andersen’s residence was tested for\n\nblood, semen, saliva, and DNA. A forensic analyst found that the pipe was positive for\n\nblood and that a “single-source male DNA profile obtained from the staining on the\n\ninterior of the plastic tube or pipe matches [J.E.F.],” specifically noting that it was “72\n\noctillion times more likely to observe this DNA profile if it originated from [J.E.F.] rather\n\nthan an unrelated individual.” Other swabs of the pipe indicated that there may have\n\nbeen two contributors and that “it is 65 octillion times more likely to observe this DNA\n\nprofile if it originated from John Andersen and [J.E.F.]” rather than from other\n\nindividuals. The forensic analyst also tested the other evidence—a large wooden dowel\n\nand a smaller wooden dowel—finding similar staining and both J.E.F.’s and Andersen’s\n\nDNA profiles.\n\n\n        1 The record indicates that an “colostomy bag” is attached to a person’s stomach to manually filter\n\nfeces out of their intestines to allow the rectum to heal. And a urinary catheter is a tube that is inserted\ninto a person’s urinary tract to manually remove urine.\n         2 The SANE nurse testified that a SANE nurse “respond[s] specifically to patients with reports of\n\nor concerns of sexual assault, and we tend to them by collecting evidence, documenting injuries, creating\na document.” A SANE also will “interview the patient… to get a sense of where we might find injuries or\nwhere we might find evidence.”\n\n\n                                                     4\n\fNo. 86089-5-I/5\n\n\n       In September 2022, Andersen was charged with rape in the first degree by\n\nforcible compulsion and assault in the first degree, with an aggravating circumstance\n\nthat the crime was motivated by sexual gratification. The State amended the charges\n\nagainst Andersen twice. Ultimate"}

UNPUBLISHED OPINION\n\nMICHAEL STEPHEN YEH,\n\n                   Appellant.\n\n\n       FELDMAN, J. — Michael Stephen Yeh appeals his sentence for attempted\n\nrobbery in the first degree. He argues the sentencing court erred when it denied\n\nhis request for credit for confinement time served on other charges in another\n\ncounty. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n       Yeh was charged in Snohomish County on June 30, 2023 with first degree\n\nrobbery and hit-and-run with injury arising out of a robbery in which he drove the\n\ngetaway car.     That same day, the Snohomish County Superior Court found\n\nprobable cause and issued a warrant for Yeh’s arrest on these charges. The\n\nwarrant correctly listed Yeh’s address as the “King County Correctional Facility” in\n\nSeattle, but was not served on Yeh at the jail.        As the Snohomish County\n\nprosecutor explained below, it is “not normal[]” to serve arrest warrants on\n\nindividuals incarcerated in other counties. At that time, Yeh was held on bail in\n\fNo. 87107-2-I\n\n\nKing County jail on various King County felony offenses involving alleged identity\n\ntheft. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced on May 17,\n\n2024, in King County Superior Court to 50 months of confinement with credit for\n\ntime served and transported to the Washington Department of Corrections\n\nfollowing sentencing. The King County proceedings are relevant but not at issue\n\nin this appeal.\n\n        On July 15, 2024, Yeh pleaded guilty in Snohomish County Superior Court\n\nto an amended count of attempted robbery in the first degree and was sentenced\n\nto 108 months of confinement to run concurrently with his King County sentence.\n\nRelevant to this appeal, Yeh argued he should have been given credit for\n\nconfinement time served in the King County jail while he had an active felony\n\nwarrant and pending charges in Snohomish County (a total of approximately 10\n\nmonths). The sentencing court declined to award such credit, stating: “I do not\n\nfind case law that supports the giving of credit for time when an outstanding warrant\n\nwas issued but not served.”\n\n        Yeh appeals.\n\n                                                 II\n\n        Yeh argues the sentencing court erred when it denied his request for credit\n\nfor confinement time served in the King County jail while he had an active felony\n\nwarrant and pending charges in Snohomish County. 1 We disagree.\n\n        RCW 9.94A.505(6) governs credit for confinement time served before\n\nsentencing. It provides, “The sentencing court shall give the offender credit for all\n\n\n1 Yeh does not argue that his attorney could have but failed to facilitate service of the warrant in\n\nanticipation of a “global” resolution.\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 87107-2-I\n\n\nconfinement time served before the sentencing if that confinement was solely in\n\nregard to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced.” We review issues\n\nof statutory construction de novo. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 2 of Pac. County v. Comcast\n\nof Wash. IV, Inc., 8 Wn. App. 2d 418, 449, 438 P.3d 1212 (2019). “Statutory\n\nconstruction begins by reading the text of the statute or statutes involved. If the\n\nlanguage is unambiguous, a reviewing court is to rely solely on the statutory\n\nlanguage.” State v. Roggenkamp, 153 Wn.2d 614, 621, 106 P.3d 196 (2005).\n\n        Applying the unambiguous language of RCW 9.94A.505(6), the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Yeh’s request for credit for confinement time served in the\n\nKing County jail while he had an active felony warrant and pending charges in\n\nSnohomish County. That is so because Yeh was confined in King County jail in\n\nregard to the identify theft charges in King County, not the pending charges in\n\nSnohomish County. Thus, the trial court could not properly grant Yeh’s request for\n\ncredit for confinement time served in the King County jail because RCW\n\n9.94A.505(6) limits credit for confinement time served before sentencing to\n\nconfinement “in regard to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced.” 2\n\n        Contrary to Yeh’s argument, State v. Enriquez-Martinez, 198 Wn.2d 98, 492\n\nP.3d 162 (2021), does not require a different result. There, Enriquez-Martinez was\n\narrested in Oregon on charges related to sexual offenses against a minor. Id. at\n\n100. While he was in custody in Oregon, charges related to abuse of the same\n\n\n\n2 To mandate the result advocated by Yeh, the legislature could amend RCW 9.94A.505(6) to\n\nrequire sentencing courts to give offenders credit for confinement time served before sentencing in\nregard to offenses other than those for which they are being sentenced where, as here, the\nsentences for those offenses are to be served concurrently. But that is not what RCW 9.94A.505(6)\nsays, and “[w]e cannot add words or clauses to an unambiguous statute when the legislature has\nchosen not to include that language.” State v. Delgado, 148 Wn.2d 723, 727, 63 P.3d 792 (2003).\n\n                                               -3-\n\fNo. 87107-2-I\n\n\nvictim were filed in Washington. Id. The Washington court issued a no-bail warrant\n\nfor his arrest and served the warrant on Enriquez-Martinez in Oregon.             Id.\n\nEnriquez-Martinez continued to be held in custody in Oregon. Id. Several months\n\nlater, he accepted a global plea offer to resolve all charges in both states. Id.\n\nUnder that plea deal, he would receive concurrent sentences and be given credit\n\nfor confinement time served before sentencing. Id.\n\n       Enriquez-Martinez was subsequently transferred to Washington to enter his\n\nplea. “As part of the boilerplate language of the judgment and sentence, he\n\nreceived ‘credit for time served prior to sentencing if that confinement was solely\n\nunder this cause number.’” Id. at 100-01 (quoting judgment and sentence). When\n\nEnriquez-Martinez began serving his sentence in Washington, he was not given\n\ncredit for time served in Oregon before sentencing. Id. at 101. To resolve that\n\nissue, he filed a motion “to correct his sentence to make clear he was entitled to\n\ncredit for the time he had served after the Washington warrant was served.” Id.\n\nThe trial court denied his motion, and the court of appeals affirmed. Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court granted review and reversed. Id. at 100. Although\n\nEnriquez-Martinez had not been confined in Oregon solely in regard to the offense\n\nfor which he was sentenced in Washington, the court held “a defendant is entitled\n\nto credit for all the time they were confined on charges prior to sentencing on those\n\ncharges, regardless of how many charges they were held on.” Id. at 103. The\n\ncourt explained:\n\n       As a matter of constitutional law, defendants are entitled to credit for\n       all time served in confinement on a criminal charge, whether that time\n       is served before or after sentencing. The legislature has attempted\n       to capture that principle in RCW 9.94A.505(6) . . . . But our\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fNo. 87107-2-I\n\n\n      constitution does not allow us to treat offenders who cannot obtain\n      bail differently from those who can.\n\nId. at 101-02 (internal citations omitted). The court also explained its holding was\n\n“based on the constitutional principle that a defendant cannot be held longer\n\nbecause of poverty.” Id. at 103.\n\n      Yeh’s reliance on Enriquez-Martinez is misplaced. Critical here, the court’s\n\nrecitation of the facts in Enriquez-Martinez confirms that “the Washington warrant\n\nwas served.” Id. at 101. Thus, while Enriquez-Martinez was not confined in\n\nOregon prior to sentencing in Washington solely in regard to the offense for which\n\nhe was sentenced in Washington, he was nonetheless con"}

The superior court dismissed the petition, concluding that\n\nthe District failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and thus lacked standing. The\n\nDistrict appealed. We hold that while the District did not itself raise the issues during the\n\nadministrative review, the issues are preserved because another party raised them. We\n\ntherefore reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\fNo. 86736-9-I/2\n\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       In March 2022, Respondents Seyed Ali Malek Abadi, Sarvenaz Jenabi, Farhad\n\nFarzami, and Seiran Khaledian (Property Owners) purchased two neighboring\n\nundeveloped parcels in a single real estate transaction with the intent to develop each\n\nparcel with a single-family home. The parcels are located within unincorporated King\n\nCounty for construction and other permitting purposes and are at the eastern edges of\n\nthe service area of Woodinville Water District for water availability purposes. Because\n\napplications for new construction require certificates of available water and sewer\n\nservices from the District prior to submitting a development permit, the Property Owners\n\napplied for water service with the District. On February 11, 2022, the District issued the\n\nProperty Owners a King County Certificate of Water Availability (CWA) determining that\n\nthe District could provide service in a “timely and reasonable” manner.\n\n       On January 9, 2023, the Property Owners appealed the District’s offer of service\n\nfor the two undeveloped parcels to the King County Utilities Technical Review\n\nCommittee (UTRC), arguing that the District’s offer of service was not timely or\n\nreasonable due to financial burden. As a result, the Property Owners requested\n\napproval of a new individual private well for water service on the property. On\n\nJanuary 17, 2023, the District submitted a letter in response to the application that\n\naddressed both appeals.\n\n       Between January and May 2023, the District and the Property Owners engaged\n\nin a series of meetings with the UTRC, during which the Property Owners provided\n\nsupplemental information concerning the costs of construction and discussed the\n\nDistrict’s potential alternative options to serve the parcels with water. The Property\n\n                                             2\n\fNo. 86736-9-I/3\n\n\nOwners also proposed an alternative water service route that was similar to the\n\nDistrict’s proposed route. At the May 19, 2023 hearing on the appeal, the District 1\n\nargued that the CWA was consistent with its utility policy and that the terms and\n\nconditions were reasonable. Because the Property Owners could not show that the\n\npotential options offered by the District were not timely or reasonable, the UTRC denied\n\nthe requests for either an alternative system or a private permit exempt well.\n\n        On June 29, 2023, the Property Owners appealed the UTRC’s decisions to the\n\nKCHE. 2 Among other arguments, the Property Owners contended that the UTRC\n\ndecision should be reversed as it did not apply the relevant code. They cited to the East\n\nKing County Coordinated Water System Plan (CWSP), Section V.2.A.2 which states,\n\n“Should the utility not be willing or able to provide timely service or the applicant\n\nconsiders the conditions of service to be unreasonable, the applicant will be referred to\n\nSKCHD[3] for action as described in the first instance above.”4 According to the Property\n\nOwners, because the District was unwilling or unable to provide timely service, and they\n\nconsidered the conditions of service to be unreasonable, the UTRC was legally\n\nobligated to refer them to SKCHD for construction of a private exempt well.\n\n        The UTRC requested a hearing on the consolidated appeal before the KCHE. In\n\naddition to the contact information for the applicants/appellants, the request identified\n\n“Principal Staff” as the UTRC Chair, Daniel Cardwell, and King County senior deputy\n\n\n        1 The UTRC decision states generally that “District staff” provided feedback. Its initial response\n\nletter was drafted by Marci Chew, Senior Engineering Technician with Woodinville. An engineer for the\nDistrict, Christian Hoffman, attended the hearing.\n          2 The KCHE consolidated the two appeals. As the basis for the two UTRC Decisions was the\n\nsame in each, we refer to them as one decision.\n          3 Seattle-King County Health Department. Public Health-Seattle & King County is the successor\n\nagency to SKCHD.\n          4 The Property Owners also cite to the King County Code (KCC) that codified the CWSP, which is\n\nKCC 13.28.055.\n\n                                                     3\n\fNo. 86736-9-I/4\n\n\nprosecuting attorney from the Department of Local Services (Department), Jina Kim.\n\nThe request also listed “Interested Party” Christian Hoffman from the District. At a\n\nprehearing conference on July 31, 2023, Hoffman was present. When determining the\n\nbriefing schedule and selecting a hearing date, Hoffman requested a later hearing date\n\nto accommodate a conflicting District board meeting. The KCHE issued a “Prehearing\n\nOrder and Notice of Briefing and Remote Hearing” on August 7, 2023, identifying the\n\nProperty Owners as the appellants and the Department as the representative for King\n\nCounty.\n\n       The Property Owners filed a motion for summary judgment arguing the “UTRC\n\nignored its code mandated obligation to refer the water service request to Public Health\n\nfor issuance of a well permit . . . which it was required to do under CWSP, section\n\nV.2A.2, and KCC 13.28.055.” Alternatively, the Property Owners requested a remand to\n\ndirect the UTRC to refer the matter to the East King County Regional Water Association\n\n(EKRWA) for its “input and mediation” pursuant to the CWSP. The Department\n\ncontested the motion based on subsequent “changes to the law, corresponding plan\n\nupdates, and the cessation of review functions by Public Health and EKRWA.” On\n\nOctober 25, 2023, the KCHE denied the Property Owners’ motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       The Property Owners filed a motion for reconsideration, and the Department\n\nagain provided briefing in opposition to the motion. The KCHE considered the motions\n\nwithout oral argument and issued a final decision on December 22, 2023, granting the\n\nmotion for summary judgment and reversing the UTRC decisions. It ordered a remand\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fNo. 86736-9-I/5\n\n\non the matter “to Public Health to proceed as it would with any other building permit\n\napplication where there is no ‘reasonable’ water service offer from a district.”\n\n        On January 12, 2024, the District filed a LUPA petition with the King County\n\nSuperior Court seeking review of the KCHE’s final administrative decision. The Property\n\nOwners moved to dismiss the petition, contending that the District failed to exhaust its\n\nadministrative remedies because it failed to intervene or take a position in the\n\nunderlying land use appeal and, thus, lacked standing to appeal under RCW\n\n36.70C.060. 5 The superior court agreed and granted the motion t"}

Hart\nAlbuquerque, NM\n\nfor Appellant\n\nRaúl Torrez, Attorney General\nCharles J. Gutierrez, Senior Solicitor General\nSanta Fe, NM\n\nfor Appellee\n\n                                       DECISION\n\nZAMORA, Justice.\n\nI.    INTRODUCTION\n\n{1}    Defendant, Julio Almentero, appeals his convictions for two counts of first-degree\nfelony murder, contrary to NMSA 1978, Section 30-2-1(A)(2) (1994), arising from the\nkidnapping and killing of two teenage victims, Collin Romero and Ahmed Lateef, and the\narmed robbery of Lateef. Defendant presents multiple challenges to the jury\n\finstructions, arguing (1) the district court’s response to the jury’s question about whether\nit could convict of both felony murder and second-degree murder was erroneous; (2) the\ndistrict court erred in not instructing the jury on second-degree murder as a lesser-\nincluded offense of felony murder; and (3) the jury instructions for felony murder and\naiding-and-abetting felony murder were “hopelessly confusing.” We disagree with\nDefendant and affirm. We exercise our discretion to decide this appeal by\nnonprecedential decision. See Rule 12-405(B)(1) NMRA.\n\nII.     BACKGROUND\n\n{2}     Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree felony murder for the\nkilling of Lateef and Romero and now appeals his sentence of life imprisonment. See\nN.M. Const. art. VI, § 2 (“Appeals from a judgment of the district court imposing a\nsentence of . . . life imprisonment shall be taken directly to the supreme court.”). He was\ntried jointly with his two codefendants, Jimmie Atkins and Stephen Goldman, Jr., each\nof whom also filed direct appeals with this Court.\n\n{3}   We adopt the recitation of facts as provided in State v. Goldman, discussing the\ncircumstances surrounding the killings and Defendant’s ensuing trial. See S-1-SC-\n40100, dec. ¶¶ 3-7 (N.M. June 30, 2025) (nonprecedential).\n\nIII.    DISCUSSION\n\n{4}    “The propriety of jury instructions given or denied is a mixed question of law and\nfact” which we review de novo. State v. Salazar, 1997-NMSC-044, ¶ 49, 123 N.M. 778,\n945 P.2d 996. We review Defendant’s preserved arguments for reversible error and the\nunpreserved arguments for fundamental error. State v. Benally, 2001-NMSC-033, ¶ 12,\n131 N.M. 258, 34 P.3d 1134.1\n\nA.      The District Court’s Response to the Jury’s Question Was an Accurate\n        Statement of the Law That Did Not Result in Reversible Error\n\n{5}    Defendant argues the district court erred by misstating the law when it responded\n“yes” to the jury’s question about whether it could return convictions for both second-\ndegree murder and felony murder. The State argues the district court did not err\nbecause it accurately responded to the jury’s question, which was based on the jury\ninstruction it had been provided. We considered the identical argument in Goldman and\nagreed with the state. See S-1-SC-40100, dec. ¶¶ 10-11. We reach the same\nconclusion here, based on the same analysis, which we adopt by reference. See id.\n\n\n\n\n1We do not address Defendant’s assertion that the “errors were so profound they were structural” as\nDefendant does not cite legal authority or argue under this standard. See State v. Turrietta, 2013-NMSC-\n036, ¶ 14, 308 P.3d 964 (“Structural error . . . is not subject to harmlessness analysis.); see also Elane\nPhotography, LLC v. Willock, 2013-NMSC-040, ¶ 70, 309 P.3d 53 (“We will not review unclear\narguments, or guess at what a party’s arguments might be.” (brackets, internal quotation marks, and\ncitation omitted)).\n\fB.     Defendant’s Remaining Challenges to the Jury Instruction Did Not Result in\n       Fundamental Error\n\n{6}    Defendant’s remaining challenges to the jury instructions were unpreserved. We\ntherefore review them for fundamental error. See Benally, 2001-NMSC-033, ¶ 12.\nFundamental error analysis requires that the Court first determine “whether error\noccurred” and, if so, “whether the error is fundamental.” State v. Romero, 2023-NMSC-\n014, ¶ 6, 533 P.3d 735 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because we\nconclude there was no error in this case, we hold there was no fundamental error.\n\n1.     The lack of a jury instruction for second-degree murder as a lesser-\n       included offense of felony murder did not result in fundamental error\n\n{7}     Defendant argues that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on\nsecond-degree murder as a lesser-included offense of felony murder, which resulted in\nfundamental error because it amounted to a failure to instruct on the essential element\nof causation for felony murder. Specifically, Defendant argues that the district court\nerred in not giving UJI 14-212 NMRA, which is the instruction for second degree\nmurder, as a lesser included offense of felony murder. An element of UJI 14-212 is that\n“[t]he defendant did not cause the death of [the Victims] during the commission of [the\nfelony].” According to Defendant, because this element was not listed in the felony\nmurder instruction the jury was not informed it had to find causation as an element of\nfelony murder. We disagree for the following reasons.\n\n{8}    First, the district court did not err in failing to give a jury instruction that was not\nrequested by the parties. Our case law has consistently held that it is the defendant’s\n“duty to make the tactical decision whether or not to seek jury instructions on lesser\ndegrees of homicide supported by the evidence, and we repeatedly have held that the\ndefendant cannot be heard to complain if the trial court instructed the jury as he\ndesired.” State v. Boeglin, 1987-NMSC-002, ¶ 10, 105 N.M. 247, 731 P.2d 943 (citing\ndecades of cases in support).\n\n{9}     Second, as explained in Goldman, Defendant’s argument lacks merit because\nthe felony-murder instruction includes an explicit causation element, which Defendant\nhas not challenged as an incomplete or misleading statement of the law. See Goldman,\nS-1-SC-40100, dec. ¶ 13; see also UJI 14-202 NMRA (requiring the jury to find “the\ndefendant caused the death . . . during the commission” of the predicate felony\n(emphasis added)). Accordingly, there was no error, let alone fundamental error. See\nState v. Adamo, 2018-NMCA-013, ¶ 27, 409 P.3d 1002 (“Since there was no reversible\nerror, it follows that there was no fundamental error in the instructions.”).\n\n2.     Defendant failed to show fundamental error in the felony-murder and\n       aiding-and-abetting jury instructions\n\n{10} Defendant argues that the use of alternatives within the felony murder and\naiding-and-abetting felony murder instructions made “them [im]possible to be properly\n\fapplied by a jury.” Defendant challenges two specific uses of the multiple “alternatives,”\nwhich we address in turn.\n\na.     The use of and/or to separate predicate felonies of kidnapping and armed\n       robbery did not result in fundamental error\n\n{11} Defendant argues his conviction must be reversed under State v. Taylor because\n“[i]t is impossible to tell what ground the jury relied on” where both the felony-murder\nand aiding-and-abetting instructions used and/or to separate the predicate felonies of\nkidnapping and armed robbery. See Taylor, 2024-NMSC-011, ¶ 21, 548 P.3d 82. The\nState disagrees with Defendant’s characterization of Taylor and its application to this\ncase. Again, Defendant’s argument is"}

Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet, 123 Hawai‘i 500,\n\n506, 236 P.3d 1236, 1242 (App. 2010).\n\n             Mathews held the lease for two apartments in the same\n\nbuilding, units 401 and 601.        Mathews stopped making monthly\n\npayments on both units and failed to cure the delinquency.\n\nHipawai filed a complaint to terminate the lease and foreclose\n\njunior liens on each unit. 2      Hipawai then moved for summary\n\njudgment and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure on each\n\nunit, which was granted.\n\n            In its order granting summary judgment and an\n\ninterlocutory decree of foreclosure, the circuit court ordered\n\nthe \"interest of Mathews in and under the Lease is hereby\n\ncancelled, terminated and foreclosed\" and further ordered that\n\n\"Mathews has no remaining right, title, or interest in the\n\nProperty[.]\"     The circuit court entered an HRCP Rule 54(b)\n\njudgment in both cases.       Mathews did not appeal from these\n\njudgments.\n\n\n\n\n      2  The complaint in 1CCV-XX-XXXXXXX was related to the unit 401 lease\nand the complaint in 1CCV-XX-XXXXXXX was related to the unit 601 lease.\n\n                                      3\n\f   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\n\n          About four months after the circuit court terminated\n\nMathews' interest in units 401 and 601, Mathews filed for\n\nbankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nDistrict of Hawai‘i.   In response to the bankruptcy form\n\nquestion, \"Do you own or have any legal or equitable interest in\n\nany residence, building, land, or similar property?\", Mathews\n\nchecked \"Yes\" and listed units 401 and 601.      The bankruptcy\n\nproceedings caused a stay in the circuit court proceedings\n\nunderlying this appeal.\n\n          According to Hipawai, it moved the bankruptcy court\n\nfor relief from the stay because units 401 and 601 were not part\n\nof Mathews' bankruptcy estate since the circuit court terminated\n\nMathews' interests in both units.      The bankruptcy court\n\npermitted Hipawai to seek clarification from the circuit court\n\nas it perceived possible ambiguity in the circuit court's\n\nsummary judgment order.\n\n          In response to Hipawai's request for clarification,\n\nthe circuit court explained it \"unambiguously terminated the\n\ninterest of Mathews in the leasehold\" of units 401 and 601, \"and\n\nthat Mathews had no remaining right, title, or interest in the\n\nProperty whatsoever[.]\"\n\n          When awarding attorneys' fees in 1CCV-XX-XXXXXXX, the\n\ncircuit court found the billing rate was \"reasonable in light of\n\nhis experience and skill\" and the work was \"reasonable and\n\n                                   4\n\f  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\n\nnecessary in light of the extraordinary amount of work that had\n\nto go into this particular matter[.]\"      And, in 1CCV-XX-XXXXXXX\n\nthe circuit court determined the fees were reasonable and did\n\nnot appear \"overbilled\" even though the rates and amount of time\n\nwere \"sort of on the higher end of the spectrum.\"\n\n          Regarding Mathews' argument that an associate rather\n\nthan a partner should have litigated the underlying cases, she\n\nprovides no authority to expressly support this proposition.\n\nHere, Hipawai had to navigate state lease termination/\n\nforeclosure proceedings and federal bankruptcy proceedings to\n\nassert its claims and defend its interests in the units.

The Decree was entered on September 6, 2023. This appeal\nfollowed.\n           Wife's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b) of\nthe Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). Hawai#i courts\nhave a policy of giving all parties the chance to have their\ncases heard on the merits, where possible. Schefke v.

Fisher v.\nFisher, 111 Hawai#i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). With that\nstandard in mind, we address what we discern to be Wife's\narguments.\n           (1) Wife argues the Decree should be vacated because\nshe wasn't served with Husband's amended income and expense\nstatement, amended asset and debt statement, amended witness\nlist, exhibit list, or exhibits 1-20 before the trial. That, she\ncontends, violated her constitutional right to due process.\n          Husband's process server filed a proof of service on\nApril 16, 2023. It shows he served the documents on Wife at the\nFederal Detention Center Honolulu, where she was being held, on\nApril 13, 2023. Husband's counsel filed a certificate of service\non August 16, 2023. An amended proof of service, signed by the\nprocess server, was filed on August 18, 2023.\n          Wife states the trial judge \"made findings that there\nwas no proof that wife was ever served those documents, and wife\nput on the record that she never received said documents.\" The\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contain no such finding.\nWife didn't request a transcript of the trial, see HRAP\nRule 10(b)(1)(A), and doesn't cite to where in the record she\nclaimed to have never received those documents, see HRAP\nRule 28(b)(7).

Wife could have asked for a continuance\n\n                                  2\n\f  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\n\nso she could study the documents, but she does not cite to the\nrecord where a request to continue was made or, if one was made,\nwhere it was denied by the Family Court. Nor does Wife make an\noffer of proof about what witnesses she would have called, or\nwhat evidence she would have tried to introduce, to controvert\ninformation in Husband's amended income and expense or asset and\ndebt statements.\n          Under these circumstances, we decline to consider\nWife's argument.\n          (2) Wife also argues she should have been awarded\nportions of Husband's 401(k) qualified profit-sharing plan and\npension plan under the \"Linson Formula\" and Hawaii Revised\nStatutes (HRS) § 580-47.\n          Linson v. Linson, 1 Haw. App. 272, 618 P.2d 748 (1980),\n\"present[ed] the issue of whether the nonvested retirement\nbenefits of one spouse constitute part of the 'estate of the\nparties' under [HRS] § 580-47 and are therefore subject to\ndivision and distribution by order of the family court upon\ngranting a divorce.\" Id. at 273–74, 618 P.2d at 749. We held\nthat \"estate of the parties\" meant \"anything of present or\nprospective value, and therefore . . . a spouse's nonvested\nmilitary retirement benefit constitutes part of the estate of the\nparties under HRS § 580-47.\" Id. at 278, 618 P.2d at 751. We\nbased our decision on equity. Id. at 277, 618 P.2d at 750-51.\nWe did not prescribe a \"formula\" for dividing or distributing\nretirement benefits.\n          HRS § 580-47 (2018) authorizes the family court to\ndivide and distribute the estate of the parties — which under\nLinson includes retirement benefits. The family court must\nconsider \"the respective merits of the parties, the relative\nabilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will\nbe left by the divorce, . . . and all other circumstances of the\ncase.\" HRS § 580-47(a).\n          Husband argued to the Family Court that although he and\nWife had been married for 26 years,\n\n                                  3\n\fNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\n\n        the last 7 years \"have been years of utter turmoil with FBI\n        raiding the marital home twice (once in 2016 and again in\n        2019) and with [Wife] ultimately going to Federal Detention\n        Center in Honolulu in 2019 where she has not been released\n        since. No outsider really knows when [Wife] started to\n        engage in criminal activities which resulted in her arrest\n        and conviction but it is undisputed that their \"marital\n        relationship\" as Husband and Wife ended in 2016/2019 wherein\n        this is not the case where Husband had filed for divorce for\n        no reason after 26 years of marriage. It is safe to say the\n        \"marriage\" as we know it in a conventional manner ended in\n        2016, thus, the duration of \"true\" marriage is only 19\n        years.\n\n              . . . Further, due to the acts of [Wife], [Husband]'s\n        standard of living went down significantly where [Husband]\n        lost his family home and has become a hoarder [sic] living\n        at his daughter's house in exchange for sharing and paying\n        for living expenses. He basically came down from being a\n        homeowner owning a $1.4 million-dollar house to a man\n        without a house at age 50. . . .\n              . . . .\n\n              . . . [Husband] has been a stevedore with Young\n        Brothers for the last 23 years. As to [Wife]'s occupation,\n        there is a belief that [Wife] was working \"doing some sort\n        of non-profit thing\" \"where she was getting scholarships and\n        grants for Kauai students\" but since her activities resulted\n        in conviction and 17-year sentence with $2.4 million dollars\n        in forfeiture and $3.3 million dollars in restitution\n        judgment, it is hard to say what occupation she had during\n        marriage. It is safer to say, [Wife] did not make any\n        financial contribution through her employment during their\n        marriage. Rather, [Wife] caused"}

Mother\nand son moved to Georgia in 2017, while father lives in Southern California. Father\nappeals from an order granting mother’s motion to transfer the child custody action to a\nGeorgia court under Family Code section 34271 on the ground California is an\ninconvenient forum, and Georgia is a more appropriate forum.2\n       Father contends the family court: (1) violated his due process rights with respect\nto the conduct of the hearing on mother’s request; (2) failed to contact the Georgia court\nbefore issuing the transfer order; (3) misapplied and failed to properly weigh the\napplicable section 3427 factors; and (4) issued an order that is procedurally defective.\nFinding no merit to father’s arguments, we affirm.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In August 2015, mother obtained a three-year domestic violence restraining order\nagainst father, as well as an order awarding her sole legal and physical custody of their\nfour-year-old son and granting father supervised visitation. In 2017, mother and son\nmoved to Columbia County, Georgia.\n       In 2019, father filed a request to change his visits to unsupervised, asserting he\ncompleted a court-ordered 52-week batterer’s intervention program and maintained\nregular contact with son through video and telephone calls. Father also asked the court to\nrestore son’s surname, as he claimed mother changed son’s surname without notice to\nhim and without his consent. In her responsive declaration, mother objected to father’s\nrequest for unsupervised visits and asked that the matter be transferred from the Fresno\n\n\n1      Undesignated statutory references are to the Family Code.\n2      An appeal may be taken “[f]rom an order … granting a motion to stay the action\non the ground of inconvenient forum.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 904.1, subd. (a)(3).) An\nappeal may also be taken from an order made after an appealable judgment. (Id.,\nsubd.

Father provided the court with proof of completion of the\nbatterer’s program. The court set a contested hearing for rebuttal of section 3044.3 At\nthe October 2019 hearing, the court found father had successfully rebutted the\nsection 3044 presumption and referred the parties to mediation. At an August 2020\nhearing, the court issued an order that granted mother and father joint legal custody of\nson but continued to give mother sole physical custody. Father was granted unsupervised\nday visits in South Carolina and Georgia. It is unclear from the record what happened\nwith mother’s request to change venue to Georgia.\n       In January 2022, mother filed a request for an order granting her sole legal custody\nof son. In response, father requested overnight visits in California, joint legal and\nphysical custody of son, and that mother be prohibited from referring to father as\nanything other than “dad and father.” Father attached a December 2019 order from the\nSuperior Court of Columbia County, Georgia, that set aside and vacated a January 2019\norder that changed son’s surname. The Georgia court found mother’s motion to serve\nfather by publication omitted pertinent facts, including that the parties were involved in\nongoing litigation in California concerning custody, visitation, and child support issues,\nand father maintained regular telephone or video visitation with son, and had it known\nthese facts, it would never have allowed father to be served by publication. Accordingly,\nthe Georgia court found its January 2019 order changing son’s surname should not have\n\n\n\n3     Section 3044 creates “a rebuttable presumption that an award of sole or joint\nphysical or legal custody of a child to a person who has perpetrated domestic violence is\ndetrimental to the best interest of the child.” (§ 3044, subd. (a).)\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fbeen entered. The Georgia court further stated the California Superior Court appeared to\nhave continuing jurisdiction over the parties and issues raised in the Georgia court.\n       The family court ordered the parties to mediation. In June 2022, after mother\nrequested a contested hearing, the family court entered an order that temporarily adopted\na mediator’s recommendation to order a graduated visitation plan that increased father’s\ncustodial/visitation time with son, including overnight weekend visits. The contested\nhearing was held in May 2023, when the family court granted mother and father joint\nphysical custody of son, with son to live with father in California for a portion of son’s\nsummer vacation. Son was to live with father for a minimum of two weeks in 2023,\nwhich would increase by one week in each of the following years.\n       In December 2023, mother filed a request to modify the visitation order and\nchange venue to the Columbia County Superior Court in Georgia. Mother asserted in her\ndeclaration that she was requesting transfer of the case to Georgia because: (1) none of\nthe parties resided in Fresno County and had not done so for over eight years; (2) now\n12-year-old son lived with mother since his birth, the two had not lived in Fresno County\nsince 2015, and they had not resided in California since 2017; (3) mother and son had\nlived in Columbia County, Georgia, since August 2017; (4) father had not been a resident\nof Fresno County since 2015; and (5) mother and father appeared via telephone for\nhearings and mediations, and son had been required to travel for a court-related\nappointment at least once and attended the last mediation via video call. Mother hoped\nthere would not be a need to return to court for requests for orders or modifications, but if\nsuch a need arose, she believed it made sense to transfer the case to Columbia County,\nGeorgia, since son had lived more than half his life there. The family court referred the\nparties to mediation in February 2024.\n       Father filed a responsive declaration objecting to mother’s request for change of\nvenue on April 3, 2024. Father asserted the courts in California and Georgia determined\nin February 2020 that the Fresno County family court was the rightful jurisdiction and\n\n                                          "}

Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436 (Wende),\nChaney’s appellate counsel requested that we review the record\nand determine whether any arguable issues exist. We have\nreviewed the entire record and find no arguable issues. We\naffirm.\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nI.    Facts\n      Chaney lived in unit 17 at the Windsor Apartments at 1150\nTennyson Street in Manhattan Beach, California. On April 2,\n2023, at about 10:00 p.m., a neighbor named Kellie Mieras heard\nloud banging and crashing noises coming from the unit occupied\nby Chaney. The noises continued for a few minutes, stopped,\nthen resumed for about 10 to 15 minutes. Mieras went to her\nbalcony and saw Chaney’s girlfriend, Josephine St. John (also\nknown as Jo), by a car on the street. She saw Chaney on the\ngrass, talking to Richard Phillippi, another resident of the\nWindsor Apartments. Mieras went back inside her unit and later\nwent to her balcony a second time when she heard running\nwater. At 10:15 p.m., she sent several text messages to Alison\nWattles, the owner of the Windsor Apartments. Mieras never\nsaw Chaney enter or exit or inside unit 17.\n      Another resident named Frank Saverino received a group\ntext that stated there was a lot of commotion. Saverino looked\nover the railing outside of his apartment and saw Chaney\nwalking down the stairs toward the back of the building. A few\nminutes later, Saverino saw Chaney at the end of the driveway.\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\f       Phillippi was inside unit 19 when he heard a ruckus. He\nlooked out his patio door and saw a black Jeep with the lights on\nand all doors open. He heard a man and woman screaming at\neach other. He believed they were Chaney and St. John.\nPhillippi called the police. At some point, Phillippi spoke with\nChaney outside.\n       At about 10:17 p.m., Manuel Acuna, a police officer for the\ncity of Manhattan Beach responded to a call regarding a\ndisturbance at 1150 Tennyson Street. When he arrived, he spoke\nwith Chaney. He also spoke with St. John and determined that\nno crime had occurred. Acuna instructed Chaney to separate\nfrom St. John to avoid additional calls. St. John drove away.\n       Wattles arrived and told Acuna that she was informed that\nChaney was breaking things inside the unit from which he was\nevicted. At 10:40 p.m., Acuna went inside unit 17 and saw\ndamage to the walls and front door, flooding in the kitchen, and\nbroken pipes under the kitchen sink. He saw the balcony door\nopen. The closet door was damaged on the bottom left corner.\n       John Rezendez worked for Wattles doing maintenance at\nthe Windsor Apartments. He went to the complex with Wattles\nat about 10:15 p.m. Resendez entered unit 17 through the rear\nbalcony where the screen door was closed but the sliding glass\ndoor was open. He heard water running and went to the\nbathroom where he saw the faucet on. He also saw holes in the\nwalls. Resendez heard water running in the kitchen. He saw\nwater coming out from the sink on to the floor. The pipe\nconnecting the two kitchen sinks was removed.\n       When Wattles arrived at the apartment complex on April 2,\n2023, she took an officer inside unit 17. Wattles saw the pipe\nunder the kitchen sink broken and damage to the kitchen\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fcabinet. She saw water on the floor. She also saw holes in an\ninterior door, the bedroom and bathroom doors, and the bedroom\nwall. The window shades were torn off the sliding glass door,\nwhich was broken.\n       To repair the damage sustained on April 2, Wattles had to\nhave the doors removed, the walls patched and repainted, and\nthe floor in the kitchen demolished. These repairs totaled $1,850.\nAdditional costs for mold remediation and replacement of the\nfloor, closet door, and kitchen plumbing were estimated to be\nabout $19,000.\n       A court’s minute order indicated that Chaney could be\nevicted from unit 17 from March 31, 2023. According to Wattles,\nChaney did not have permission to be in unit 17 on April 2, 2023.\nShe conducted a walk-through inspection of unit 17 on either\nMarch 31 or April 1. Wattles noted that the unit required only\nsmall repairs. She did not observe any of the damage that she\nsaw on April 2.\nII.   Procedure\n       On October 14, 2024, a jury convicted Chaney of one count\nof felony vandalism with damage exceeding $400 (Pen. Code, §\n594, subd. (a)). But the jury did not find that the amount of\ndamage exceeded $10,000.\n       On October 30, 2024, the trial court suspended imposition\nof sentence and placed Chaney on two years of formal probation.\n       Chaney filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                4\n\f                         DISCUSSION\nIndependent Review Pursuant to People v. Wende\n      We appointed counsel to represent Chaney on appeal.\nCounsel filed an opening brief that includes the facts and\nprocedural history of the case and requests that we review the\nrecord and determine whether there are any arguable issues on\nappeal. (Wende, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 441.) Counsel advised\nChaney of the right to file a supplemental brief within 30 days\nfrom the date that she filed the opening brief. Chaney did not file\na supplemental brief.\n      We have examined the entire record. We are satisfied that\nno arguable issues exist, and Chaney’s counsel has fully satisfied\nher responsibilities under Wende. (Smith v.

No. 19NF011540A)\n           Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n         Defendant Dannielle Heather Coleman appeals a judgment following\nher plea of no contest to possession of methamphetamine for sale. The trial\ncourt sentenced her to two years of supervised probation. Coleman argues\nthat her sentence is unauthorized because she did not orally plead no contest\nto the methamphetamine charge in open court. We disagree and affirm.\n                                               I. BACKGROUND\n         In January 2020, the People filed a felony information charging\nColeman with possession of methamphetamine for sale. (Health & Saf. Code,\n§ 11378.) She initially pled not guilty.\n         In June 2024, the trial court called the case for trial. Coleman\nappeared and her counsel informed the court that Coleman wanted to retain\nprivate counsel. The court denied the request as untimely and asked\n\n\n                                                               1\n\fColeman if she was prepared to go to trial that afternoon. She responded\nthat she did not want to go to trial and would “accept the [pretrial] offer.”\nThe court passed the matter so that Coleman could speak with her counsel.\nThe court later recalled the case and asked the parties how they would like to\nproceed. Coleman’s counsel responded, “[i]t’s my understanding that\n[Coleman] wants to go ahead with a People versus West1 plea to the charge.”\nHe then presented the court with a no contest plea form signed by Coleman.\nThe court asked Coleman if she had an opportunity to review this plea form\nwith her counsel and she responded, “[y]es.”\n      The trial court then asked Coleman whether she understood that “[i]f”\nshe entered “a People v. West plea,” she would be found guilty of the offense\n(provided the prosecution “state[d] sufficient facts”) and would be waiving her\nright to a jury trial. The court continued that this included a waiver of her\n“right to confront and cross-examine any witnesses called against [her]” as\nwell as her right to testify or remain silent at trial. Coleman replied, “[y]es.”\nThe court then asked Coleman if it was her understanding that she would\nreceive “two years felony probation, 60 days in the county jail” as an “outcome\nof a finding of guilty” and she again replied, “[y]es.”\n      After the prosecution provided a factual basis for the plea, the trial\ncourt found Coleman “guilty pursuant to People v. West,” suspended the\nimposition of sentence, and placed her on two years of supervised probation.\nColeman timely appealed.\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n      Coleman argues that reversal is warranted because although she\n\n\n\n      1 People v. West (1970) 3 Cal.3d 595, 611 [trial court “may accept a\n\nbargained plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any lesser offense reasonably\nrelated to the offense charged in the accusatory pleading,” italics omitted].\n\n                                         2\n\fsigned a written plea agreement, “she never orally made that plea in open\ncourt.” She contends that this omission violated Penal Code2 section 1018,\nwhich provides that “[u]nless otherwise provided by law, every plea shall be\nentered or withdrawn by the defendant himself or herself in open court.”\n(Italics added.) We are unpersuaded and find that the record establishes\nsubstantial compliance with section 1018.\n      “ ‘Where a reasonable attempt has been made to comply with a statute\nin good faith, . . . the doctrine of substantial compliance holds that the statute\nmay be deemed satisfied.’ . . . ‘Substantial compliance means “ ‘actual\ncompliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective\nof the statute,’ as distinguished from ‘mere technical imperfections of\nform.’ ” ’ ” (People v. Green (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 360, 371.) The doctrine of\nsubstantial compliance applies to section 1018. (See People v. Reeves (1966)\n64 Cal.2d 766, 772 [trial court did not err in accepting a plea where there was\n“sufficient compliance” with section 1018].)\n      This aligns with the text of section 1018 itself, which states that “[t]his\nsection shall be liberally construed to effect these objects and to promote\njustice.” (Italics added.) Indeed, “[t]he purpose of the requirement that a\nplea be entered by defendant personally is to ensure that the plea is his own.\nIf it is, the purpose of that requirement is accomplished.” (In re Martinez\n(1959) 52 Cal.2d 808, 815.) “The nature of the right provided by . . . section\n1018 is not such that the plea must be expressed in person under any and all\ncircumstances.” (People v. Gibbs (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 596, 599–600\n(Gibbs).) To that end, section 1018 is satisfied “if the defendant ‘authorized\nor adopted counsel’s statement of his plea.’ ” (People v. Martin (1964) 230\n\n\n      2 All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless\n\notherwise noted.\n\n                                        3\n\fCal.App.2d 62, 63.)\n      That is what occurred here. Coleman initially told the trial court, “I\ndon’t want to go to trial. I will accept the offer.” (Italics added.) After her\ncounsel spoke to her during a break, he stated in open court that Coleman\nwanted to proceed with a People v. West (no contest) plea. Coleman had\nsigned a no contest plea form and acknowledged in open court that she had\nreviewed it with her counsel. The court then proceeded to ask Coleman a\nseries of questions, including whether she understood she would be waiving\nher right to a jury trial—which included her right to confront witnesses and\ntestify—and whether she understood that she would receive two years of\nprobation if found guilty pursuant to the plea. Coleman replied yes to each\nquestion and did not voice any disagreement with her counsel’s statement\nregarding her plea. Accordingly, the record “does not permit any other\nconclusion than that [she] did consent to, and adopt, [her] counsel’s statement\nof [her] plea[ ].” (Gibbs, supra, 188 Cal.App.2d at p. 601.) Section 1018 was\ntherefore satisfied.\n      Coleman’s attempt to distinguish the cases cited by the People is\nunavailing. For example, Coleman argues that unlike here, the trial court in\nPeople v. Niendorf (1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 594, 597, asked the defendant,\n“ ‘you understand the nature of the charge that is involved, so that you\nunderstand the nature of the plea that you have made?’ ” Although the court\nhere did not ask Coleman whether she understood the nature of her plea, it\ndid ask her in greater detail whether she understood the implications of her\nplea—including the various rights she would be giving up and the sentence\nshe would be receiving. From Coleman’s affirmative responses to the court’s\nquestions, it is clear that she agreed with her counsel’s statement that she\nwould be entering a People v. West plea and understood the nature of that\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fplea. We therefore see no practical difference between the colloquies in\nNiendorf and this case.\n      Coleman also points to People v. Manriquez (1922) 188 Cal. 602, 605, a\ncase in which our high court found that the defendant’s “direct and explicit\nconfession of guilt,” which "}

Nero argues in his reply that we cannot rely on trial\ntranscripts at the prima facie stage, but concedes that it may be\nappropriate to rely on the clerk’s transcript, trial court minutes,\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fLewis (2021) 11 Cal.5th 952, 972 (Lewis) [appellate opinion\ngenerally part of record of conviction as applied to § 1172.6\nproceedings].) We therefore quote its description of the trial\nevidence, which is in the published portion of the opinion. (People\nv. Nero (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 504 (Nero).) We provide these\nfacts only “for background purposes and to provide context for the\nparties’ arguments.” (People v.

The prosecution’s case-in-chief.\n       “On September 27, 2006, Milton Yates was found stabbed\nto death in a parking lot fronting a laundromat and a market.\nVideos from the laundromat’s and market’s surveillance cameras\nshowed Yates riding a bicycle in the parking lot. [Fn. omitted.]\nNero and Brown came out of the market. Brown got into a car,\nbut Nero remained outside, urinating. Yates rode his bicycle\naround the car, and Nero walked to him. Brown got out of the\ncar and, after watching the two men, walked to them. Yates and\nNero fought. At one point, Nero grabbed the back of his pants\nand bent near the back of his car. Nero stabbed Yates with a\nknife four times. Autopsy results showed that Yates ingested\ncocaine and ethyl alcohol within hours of his death.\n       “Detective Sunny Romero examined Yates’s bicycle, but he\ndid not find it possessed any evidentiary value. A photograph of\n\n\njury instructions, verdict form, appellate opinion, closing\narguments, and information. (See People v. Beaudreaux (2024)\n100 Cal.App.5th 1227, 1232–1233 [record of conviction consisted\nof clerk’s transcript, trial court minutes, jury instructions,\nverdicts from underlying proceedings, and prior appellate\nopinion].)\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fthe bicycle, however, shows a black object bound to the bicycle’s\nframe where a water bottle would normally be attached.\n       “B. The defense case.\n       “Nero testified. [Fn. omitted.] Brown is his older sister and\nhas been his legal guardian since their mother passed away when\nhe was 13. Around 2003 or 2004, Nero was convicted of grand\ntheft and of driving a vehicle without the owner’s consent. As a\nresult, he went to prison, where he developed a fear of knives. In\n2004, he was shot and hospitalized for two to three weeks.\n       “On the afternoon of September 26, 2006, Nero ran into\nYates. Nero had never seen Yates in the neighborhood, but Nero\nasked him for a quarter to buy a cigarette. Later that night, Nero\nand Brown went to the liquor store to buy beer. Nero went inside\nthe store, and when he came out, he urinated, and Brown got into\ntheir car. Yates approached Brown, who is a lesbian, and called\nher a ‘bull dyke’ and ‘bitch.’ Yates made other comments and\nhand gestures by moving his hands back and forth. He went to\nthe driver’s side of the car and threatened Nero. He challenged\nNero to a fight, saying ‘ “bring it on.” ’ Nero approached Yates,\nand Yates hit him. Yates did not appear to be sober.\n        “ ‘Green Eyes’ pulled up in a car. Nero asked Green Eyes\n what he would do if someone disrespected his sister. Green Eyes\n said it depended on the situation. Green Eyes left, and Yates\n and Nero resumed fighting. When Nero knelt by the back of his\n car, he was merely pretending to get a weapon. And when he\n grabbed the back of his pants, he was merely pulling them up\n because they were baggy. Yates got a weapon from his bicycle\n and stabbed Nero’s arm, creating a scar that was visible at trial.\n Struggling over the weapon, the two men fell. Yates dropped the\n knife. [Fn. omitted.] Nero picked it up and stabbed Yates, but\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f he did not intend to kill Yates. Nero dropped the knife.\n        “Throughout the altercation between Nero and Yates,\n Brown was telling them to stop. She never told her brother to\n fight Yates or encouraged him in any way, and she did not hand\n him a knife. In his later statement to the police, Nero\n maintained he acted in self-defense and that his sister told him\n to stop.\n       “C. Rebuttal case.\n        “Detective Salaam Abdul examined Yates’s bicycle, which\n was never booked into evidence but was instead released to the\n victim’s son. At trial, he could not recall what the black item on\n the bike was, but he believed it was ‘some balled up like plastic\n that looked like it was crunched together.’ He did not find\n anything on the bike having, in his opinion, evidentiary value.”\n (Nero, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at pp. 507–509.)\nTrial, Verdict, and Sentencing\n       The People charged Nero with first degree murder (§ 187,\nsubd. (a)) and alleged he had personally used a knife in the\ncommission of the offense (§ 12022, subd. (b)(1)). The information\nalso charged Brown with first degree murder (§ 187, subd. (a)).\n       In 2007, the People jointly tried Nero and Brown before a\njury. In closing argument, the prosecutor argued Nero stabbed\nYates a"}

(a),\n\ncount 1), second degree robbery (§ 211, count 2), dissuading a witness (§ 136.1,\n\nsubd. (c)(1), count 3), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (former § 12021,\n\nsubd. (a)(1), count 4). The jury additionally found true allegations that defendant\n\npersonally used a firearm in his commission of the carjacking and robbery. (§ 12022.53,\n\nsubd. (b).) The court thereafter found true allegations that defendant had suffered a prior\n\nserious felony conviction (§667, subd. (a)), a prior prison term (§ 667.5, subd. (b)), and a\n\nprior strike conviction (§§ 667, subds. (c), (e) & 1170.12, subd. (c)). (People v. Rodas\n\n(May 25, 2010, E049426) [nonpub. opn.] (Rodas).)\n\n       The court sentenced defendant to 39 years of imprisonment; the court imposed but\n\nstayed sentence on the prior prison term enhancement. (Rodas, supra, E049426.)\n\n       Defendant appealed. This court affirmed the judgment.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Defendant contends this court should reverse and remand the matter with\n\ndirections to the trial court to hold a full resentencing hearing. The People agree.3 We\n\nreverse and remand the matter with directions to the trial court to hold a full resentencing\n\nhearing.\n\n       “In 2019, in an effort to reduce the societal and fiscal burdens of incarceration, the\n\nLegislature passed Senate Bill No. 136 (2019–2020 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill No. 136),\n\nwhich amended section 667.5[, subdivision] (b) to eliminate prior-prison-term\n\nenhancements for all prior crimes except for ‘sexually violent offense[s] as defined in\n\nsubdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.’ (Stats. 2019,\n\n       2 “[S]ection 1172.75 does not authorize a defendant to seek resentencing on his or\nher own motion or petition. Rather the process is triggered by the Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation [CDCR] identifying a defendant as a person serving a\nsentence that includes a prior prison term enhancement.

Thereafter, the California Supreme Court issued its opinion in\nPeople v. Rhodius (2025) 17 Cal.5th 1050 (Rhodius), holding that defendants whose\njudgments include stayed prior prison terms are entitled to full resentencing hearings\nwhen courts strike the now invalid prior prison term enhancements.

The trial court found Sneed had two prior serious or\nviolent felony convictions and had served a prior prison term.\nThe court sentenced Sneed to a prison term of 25 years to life\nunder the three strikes law, plus one year for the prior prison\nterm enhancement.\n       In 2023 the superior court held a resentencing hearing\nunder Penal Code section 1172.75.1 The court struck the prior\nprison term enhancement and resentenced Sneed to a prison\nterm of 25 years to life. Sneed argues the superior court abused\nits discretion in denying his request under People v. Superior\nCourt (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 (Romero) to strike his prior\nserious or violent felony convictions and in denying his request to\ndismiss those convictions under section 1385, subdivision (c). We\naffirm.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      A.    A Jury Convicts Sneed of Failing To Register as a\n            Sex Offender, and the Trial Court Sentences Him\n      Before he was released from prison on parole in 2006,\nSneed met with a correctional counselor. During that meeting\nSneed signed a document stating he had to register as a sex\noffender. When Sneed was released, he was ordered to live at a\nspecific motel, but he never checked in. Sneed moved to\n\n\n1     Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fLouisiana for a job. In 2010 he returned to California and turned\nhimself in. Sneed told his parole agent he had registered with\nthe Los Angeles Police Department in 2006, but there was no\nrecord of Sneed registering with any law enforcement agency.\n(People v. Sneed (Apr. 15, 2013, B233710) [nonpub. opn.].)\n      In 2011 a jury convicted Sneed of failing to register as a sex\noffender. (§ 290, former subd. (a)(1)(A).) The trial court found\nSneed had two prior serious or violent felony convictions, within\nthe meaning of the three strikes law (§§ 667, subds. (b)-(i),\n1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and had served a prior prison term,\nwithin the meaning of section 667.5, former subdivision (b). The\ncourt sentenced Sneed as a third strike offender to a term of\n25 years to life, plus one year for the prior prison term\nenhancement. We affirmed. (People v. Sneed, supra, B233710.)\n\n      B.     The Superior Court Resentences Sneed Under\n             Section 1172.75\n       In 2021 the Legislature declared legally invalid prior prison\nterm enhancements imposed under section 667.5, former\nsubdivision (b), before January 1, 2020, except those arising from\nconvictions for sexually violent offenses. The Legislature enacted\nsection 1172.75, which provides a procedure for resentencing\ninmates serving prison terms that include the now-invalid\nenhancements. (§ 1172.75, subd. (a).)\n       In 2023 the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\nnotified the superior court that Sneed was serving a prison term\nthat included a no-longer-valid enhancement under section 667.5,\nformer subdivision (b). Sneed asked the court to strike the\ninvalid enhancement and one of his prior serious or violent felony\nconvictions and to resentence him to a determinate term. Sneed\n\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fargued that, if he were sentenced today for failing to register as a\nsex offender, the People would not seek an indeterminate term\nunder the three strikes law. He also argued that, because of his\nage (64) and diminished physical condition (he uses a walker), he\nwas unlikely to be a danger to the community and that he\nsuffered from mental illness that should be treated in a non-\ncustodial setting. Finally, Sneed argued he had taken advantage\nof educational opportunities in prison and had not been\ndisciplined for five years.\n       The prosecutor argued Sneed’s criminal record, along with\nhis “poor performance on parole and lackluster rehabilitation\nwhile in prison,” placed him within the spirit of the three strikes\nlaw. The prosecutor stated that, if the superior court resentenced\nSneed to a determinate sentence, he would be immediately\nreleased, even though he posed an “unreasonable risk to public\nsafety” and the parole board found him unsuitable for parole in\n2022. The prosecutor also argued there was no guarantee Sneed\nwould receive the mental health treatment he needed if he were\nreleased without supervision.\n       The superior court struck the prior prison term\nenhancement but denied Sneed’s motion under Romero. The\ncourt agreed with the People that Sneed was “within the spirit of\n[the] three strikes law.” The court stated that Sneed’s prior\nserious or violent felonies included “a stabbing with a homemade\nice pick,” “forcible rape,” and “oral copulation” and that Sneed\nalso had a prior conviction for domestic violence (§ 273.5). The\ncourt also found that Sneed had “poor performance on parole”\nand that his prison record was “not spotless.” The court\nresentenced Sneed to a prison term of 25 years to life. Sneed\ntimely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f                          DISCUSSION\n\n       A.      Section 1172.75\n       Section 1172.75, subdivision (a), states: “Any sentence\nenhancement that was imposed prior to January 1, 2020,\npursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 667.5, except for any\nenhancement imposed for a prior conviction for a sexually violent\noffense . . . is legally invalid.” (See People v. Rhodius (2025)\n17 Cal.5th 1050, 1054; People v. Grajeda (2025) 111 Cal.App.5th\n829, 835-836.) Section 1172.75, subdivision (b), requires the\nDepartment to identify individuals serving terms that include\nno-longer-valid enhancements.

We originally reversed\nthe order denying Worthen’s section 1172.6 petition based on the\nsuperior court’s use of the preliminary hearing transcript and\ndirected the court to issue an order to show cause and to hold an\nevidentiary hearing.\n      The Supreme Court granted the People’s petition for\nreview, and on July 16, 2025, it transferred the case to this court\nwith directions to vacate our prior decision and reconsider the\ncause in light of its decision in People v. Patton (2025) 17 Cal.5th\n549 (Patton). We have done so and now affirm the order denying\nthe petition for resentencing. In an abundance of caution, and\nconsistent with Patton, we remand with directions for the\nsuperior court to consider an amended petition should Worthen\nseek to file one.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND2\n\nA.    The Underlying Case\n      The information charged Worthen with murder (§ 187,\nsubd. (a)) and assault on a child causing death (§ 273ab,\n\n1     All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n2     For context, we provide some factual and procedural\nbackground from the prior appellate opinion, People v. Worthen\n(Oct. 6, 2015, B259319) [nonpub. opn.], affirming Worthen’s\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fsubd. (a)), alleging Worthen beat to death his girlfriend’s\ntwo-year-old daughter. At the preliminary hearing, the\nprosecution presented testimony from Worthen’s girlfriend at the\ntime that she left him alone in her home with her sleeping\ndaughter for approximately 10 minutes. The girlfriend observed\nWorthen come out of the bedroom as she returned home. Her\ndaughter almost immediately began moaning and became limp.\nHer daughter died at the hospital. The deputy medical examiner\ntestified the cause of death was a homicide consistent with blunt\nforce trauma.\n       On August 20, 2014, Worthen entered a negotiated plea of\nno contest to second degree murder. At the time he entered his\nplea, the court advised Worthen of his constitutional rights and\nthe nature and consequences of the plea, which he stated he\nunderstood. Worthen’s trial counsel joined in the waivers of\nWorthen’s constitutional rights, concurred in the plea, and\nstipulated to a factual basis for the plea based on the police\nreport in the case. The trial court found that Worthen’s waivers\nand plea were voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, and that there\nwas a factual basis for the plea based on defense counsel’s\nstipulation.\n       The trial court sentenced Worthen, in accordance with the\nplea agreement, to an indeterminate term of 15 years to life for\nsecond degree murder with no presentence custody credit because\n\n\nconviction on direct appeal. (See People v. Cooper (2022)\n77 Cal.App.5th 393, 400, fn. 9 [reciting facts from prior appellate\nopinion “[f]or purposes of this appeal”].) We do not consider the\nfactual summary from our prior opinion in deciding whether\nWorthen established a prima facie case. (See People v. Clements\n(2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 276, 293.)\n\n\n                                 3\n\fWorthen waived the custody credit he had earned. The court\nordered Worthen to pay statutory fines, fees, and assessments.\nThe court dismissed the remaining count on the People’s motion.\n      Worthen filed a notice of appeal in which he checked the\npreprinted box indicating his appeal was “‘based on the sentence\nor other matters occurring after the plea.’” (People v. Worthen\n(Oct. 6, 2015, B259319) [nonpub. opn.].) We appointed counsel to\nrepresent him on appeal. After examination of the record,\ncounsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and Worthen did\nnot submit a supplemental brief raising any contentions or issues\nhe wanted us to consider. (See ibid.) In an unpublished opinion,\nwe affirmed the judgment against him pursuant to Smith v.\nRobbins (2000) 528 U.S. 259, 277-284, People v. Kelly (2006)\n40 Cal.4th 106, 112-113, and People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d\n436, 441. (Worthen, B259319.)\n\nB.     The Section 1172.6 Petition\n       On October 5, 2022, Worthen filed a form petition for\nresentencing under section 1172.6. He checked boxes declaring\nan information was filed against him that allowed the\nprosecution to proceed under a theory of felony murder, murder\nunder the natural and probable consequences doctrine or other\ntheory that allowed malice to be imputed to him based solely on\nhis participation in a crime, he accepted a plea offer in lieu of a\ntrial at which he could have been convicted of murder, and he\ncould not presently be convicted of murder due to amendments to\nthe Penal Code. The superior court appointed counsel to\nrepresent Worthen and directed the parties to file a response and\nreply to the petition. The People argued there was no indication\nthat Worthen was prosecuted under any theory other than that\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fhe was the actual killer, relying on the information, the\npreliminary hearing transcript, and this court’s unpublished\ndecision affirming the judgment. Worthen filed a reply disputing\nthe People’s argument.\n         The superior court denied the petition. It determined\nWorthen “was convicted of murder on his own plea in a case\nwhere it is clear from all of the documents contained in the court\nfile and the pleadings, which the court will take judicial notice\nof . . . that he was prosecuted as the actual murderer and not\nunder a theory of vicarious liability under [ ] felony murder, also\nnot as natural [and] probable consequences. He’s not entitled to\nrelief. Therefore, the petition is denied.”\n         Worthen timely appealed the denial of his petition.\n\nC.     The Appellate Proceedings\n       On May 9, 2024, we issued an opinion that reversed the\norder summarily denying Worthen’s section 1172.6 petition and\ndirected the superior court to issue an order to show cause and\nhold an evidentiary hearing on Worthen’s petition. In reaching\nour decision, we noted that “[w]hether and how a superior court\nmay consider a preliminary hearing transcript (or similar\ndocument) in making its prima facie determination has divided\nthe Courts of Appeal,” and that the issue was currently pending\nbefore the California Supreme Court. (People v. Worthen (May 9,\n2024, B328773) [nonpub. opn.], at pp. 10, 13.) We concluded that\n“until the high court rules,” we would follow the line of cases\nholding that a superior court may not rely on the preliminary\nhea"}

In 2020, James and Kristin Hart began constructing a house\n\nin Presque Isle Township, along the shores of Lake Huron. One year later, Presque Isle Zoning\n\nAdministrator Stephen Lang issued a stop-work order after neighbors claimed that the Harts’\n\nconstruction violated the Township’s zoning ordinances. The neighbors sought review of the\n\nHarts’ zoning permit with the Township’s Zoning Board of Appeals. After a hearing, the Zoning\n\nBoard revoked the Harts’ permit because the Harts had not included appropriate scaled drawings\n\nin their permit application, as required by the Township’s zoning ordinances. With the Township’s\n\nhelp, the Harts eventually obtained a new permit and completed construction of their house. But\n\nbecause the permit ordeal delayed construction for several weeks, the Harts’ builder left the job,\n\nand the Harts were unable to resume construction for another year. The Harts filed this lawsuit,\n\nalleging that the Township (1) violated their procedural-due-process rights by issuing the stop-\n\fNo. 24-2124, Hart, et al. v. Twp. of Presque Isle, Mich.\n\n\nwork order without providing notice or a pre-deprivation hearing, and (2) committed a taking\n\nwithout compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The district court granted the\n\nTownship summary judgment on both claims. We AFFIRM.\n\n                                                   I.\n\n       In 2016, the Harts purchased a 0.65-acre plat adjacent to Lake Huron in Presque Isle\n\nTownship, Michigan. Four years later, the Harts applied for a permit to construct a 2,500-square-\n\nfoot home on the plat. Presque Isle zoning ordinances specify “that every application for a zoning\n\npermit for . . . construction” be accompanied by “dimensioned plats or plans drawn to scale[.]”\n\nPresque Isle Zoning Ordinance Article 26 § 4, R. 21-26 at PageID 499–500. Accordingly, the Harts\n\nattached a drawing to their application. But the drawing lacked several components required by\n\nthe zoning ordinances, such as elevations and topographical features. Moreover, the ordinances\n\nalso make it “illegal for the Zoning Administrator to issue any permits . . . until he has inspected\n\nsuch plans in detail, and finds them to be in conformance” with the ordinances. Id. § 3, R. 21-26\n\nat PageID 499. Notwithstanding the application’s deficiencies, Lang issued the permit in July\n\n2020. The Harts commenced construction soon after.\n\n        At the beginning of the construction process, the Harts brought in many truckloads of fill-\n\ndirt and used them to raise the level of their lot, which resulted in elevating the level of their house\n\nin violation of the ordinance maximum height of 30 feet. The Harts also brought in dirt,\n\ncobblestones, and boulders to extend their lakefront footage and to build a pier with the rock and\n\ndirt. This resulted in changing the shoreline and the high-tide mark. The Harts’ neighbors, Michael\n\nBeaulac and Mary Wolfe, who lived on the adjacent property, were upset and alleged that the Harts\n\nhad cut down some of their trees and bulldozed a significant portion of the fill-dirt on to their lot.\n\nBeginning in August 2020 the neighbors repeatedly asked the Harts to remove the dirt and hired a\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 24-2124, Hart, et al. v. Twp. of Presque Isle, Mich.\n\n\nconstruction company to erect a fence but were told that such a fence could not withstand the\n\npressure and instability of the fill from the Hart property. Meanwhile, the Harts did nothing, and\n\nthe neighbors escalated the matter to the Township. The Harts eventually removed the dirt in early\n\nMay 2021, after Lang issued a mid-May ultimatum.\n\n           But the neighbors were not satisfied.1 In July 2021, they filed an appeal with the Presque\n\nIsle Zoning Board of Appeals, seeking review of Lang’s decision to grant the Harts’ permit. The\n\nneighbors stated that even though the Harts had applied for a permit to construct a 2,500-square-\n\nfoot house, the Harts’ three-story building comprised 12,000 square feet—several times larger than\n\nwhat was permitted. They alleged that the Harts’ house exceeded the zoning ordinances’ setback\n\nrequirements and limitations on building height and number of stories. They further claimed that\n\nthe Harts failed to attach detailed plans with their permit application. They asked the Zoning Board\n\nto ensure that the Harts’ building complied with the zoning ordinances.\n\n           On July 13, 2021, pursuant to pre-existing zoning ordinances—which required a stay of all\n\nproceedings that were the subject of an appeal—Lang issued a stop-work order requiring the Harts\n\nto cease construction of their house.2 Lang did not provide the Harts with any notice or conduct a\n\nhearing before issuing the order.\n\n           One month later, the Zoning Board held a special public hearing on the Harts’ permit. The\n\nneighbors and other members of the public commented on how the Harts’ construction allegedly\n\nviolated the zoning ordinances’ height and setback requirements, caused visual pollution, and\n\ndestroyed the natural beauty of the area. Lang testified that the house violated the zoning\n\n\n\n1\n  In June 2021, the neighbors sued the Harts in state court for trespass, nuisance, and breach of restrictive covenants,\nclaiming that the Harts were constructing the house without a valid permit. The case was dismissed after a three-day\nbench trial.\n2\n    Lang allowed the Harts to do limited work on the property to make it weathertight.\n\n                                                          -3-\n\fNo. 24-2124, Hart, et al. v. Twp. of Presque Isle, Mich.\n\n\nordinances by exceeding the thirty-foot height limit. The Harts, represented by counsel, were\n\nallowed to present arguments. After deliberations, the Board revoked the Harts’ permit because\n\nthe Harts failed to include compliant scaled drawings with their permit application.3 The Board\n\nnoted that the Harts would be filing for a new permit.\n\n         Lang worked closely with the Harts to reissue a permit. Several days after the Board\n\nvacated the Harts’ permit, they applied for a new permit; Lang responded that the renewed\n\napplication did not have the required scaled drawings. The Harts submitted another application\n\nwith the requisite drawings, and Lang issued a permit soon after.\n\n        In sum, the stop-work order was in effect for approximately seventy days. But because of\n\nthe interruption and uncertainty caused by the order, the Harts’ builder abandoned the project and\n\nrefused to return. The Harts were unable to secure a new builder and continue construction of their\n\nhome until January 2023.\n\n        The Harts "}

GROVER L. BENTON, JR. v. LEBOLO ROOFING AND\n    DEVELOPMENT LLC. et al.\n\n      In 2022, Grover L. Benton Jr. filed a complaint against Lebolo Roofing and\nDevelopment, LLC and Emilio Lebolo (“defendants”). In April 2023, after\ndefendants failed to file an answer or responsive pleading, the trial court entered a\ndefault judgment of $115,999.71.\n      In 2025, defendants filed a “Special Appearance Motion to Set Aside\nJudgment,” contending that they were never served with Benton’s lawsuit and that\nthe 2023 judgment was void. Because Benton’s lawsuit was closed after the trial court\nentered the judgment, the motion to set aside was assigned a new docket number by\nthe superior court clerk. See OCGA § 15-6-61 (a) (4) (A); see generally Uniform\nSuperior Court Rule 39.2.1 The trial court granted defendants’ motion to set aside the\ndefault judgment on June 30, 2025, and directed that an order setting aside the\njudgment and reopening the case would be filed in the original lawsuit.2 Benton then\n\n\n      1\n        As the trial court concluded, the 2025 action was not a new, independent\ncase, instead the new docket number simply reflected an administrative action\ntaken by the clerk pursuant to the applicable laws. See generally Cowart v. Ga.\nPower Co., 362 Ga. App. 574, 580 (1) (868 SE2d 241) (2022) (concluding that the\n“purely administrative requirement” of assigning new docket number did not\ntransform a post-judgment contempt proceeding into a“wholly new action.”).\n      2\n       Apparently an order reinstating the case was filed under the 2022 docket\nnumber, though the application materials do not contain a copy of this order.\n\ffiled, in the 2025 docket, a motion to vacate the June 30 order setting aside the default\njudgment. The trial court denied Benton’s motion to vacate and filed its order in both\ndockets. Here, Benton seeks to appeal the trial court’s order. We, however, lack\njurisdiction.\n      “The grant of a motion to set aside a default judgment . . . leaves the case\npending in the trial court below and is not a final judgment.” Laff Lines, Ltd. v.\nDimauro, 186 Ga. App. 24, 25 (366 SE2d 375) (1988) (emphasis in original); see also\nGuy v. Roberson, 214 Ga. App. 391, 392 (1) (448 SE2d 60) (1994). In like manner, the\ndenial of Benton’s motion to vacate the grant of the motion to set aside was not a final\njudgment and Benton’s 2022 lawsuit remains pending below. Thus, Benton was\nrequired to follow the interlocutory appeal procedure outlined in OCGA § 5-6-34 (b),\nwhich includes obtaining a certificate of immediate review from the trial court and\napplying to this Court for permission to appeal. See Guy, 214 Ga. App. at 392 (1).\nFurthermore, Benton’s filing of an application for a discretionary appeal does not\nexcuse him from complying with the interlocutory appeal procedures set forth in\nOCGA § 5-6-34 (b). See Eidson v. Croutch, 337 Ga. App. 542, 543 (788 SE2d 129)\n(2016).\n      Accordingly, Benton’s failure to follow the interlocutory appeal procedure\ndeprives this Court of jurisdiction to consider this application, which is hereby\nDISMISSED.\n\n                                         Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n                                           Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\n                                                                       09/08/2025\n                                                    I certify that the above is a true extract from\n                                         the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\n                                                   Witness my signature and the seal of said court\n                                         hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\n\n\n                                                                                           , Clerk.\n\f"}

App. 46, 47-48\n\n(892 SE2d 171) (2023).\n\n      The record shows that in 2022, the complainant reported to police that Bates\n\nhad raped him multiple times during 2013 to 2014, when the victim was 5 to 7 years\n\nold. He made the same allegations in a forensic interview and also alleged that Bates\n\nat a later time had approached him in a park and tried to rape him again when the\n\ncomplainant was 9 to 10 years old. Bates was then arrested for aggravated sodomy, and\n\nin October 2022, the investigator took out arrest warrants for three counts of\n\naggravated sodomy and one count each of false imprisonment and enticing a child for\n\nindecent purposes based on incidents alleged to have occurred between January 2013\n\nand December 2015.\n\n      In June 2023, the matter was transferred to Bartow County Juvenile Court by\n\nconsent order. A second forensic interview was conducted during which the\n\ncomplainant discussed the later incident, which was alleged to have occurred in\n\nDecember 2017. The matter was then dismissed on June 20, 2023. On the same day\n\n\n                                          2\n\fas the dismissal, an indictment was returned in superior court, charging Bates with\n\nenticing a child for indecent purposes and two counts of child molestation based on\n\nthe later incident occurring in December 2017. Bates filed a plea in bar, arguing that\n\nthis prosecution violated double jeopardy, specifically OCGA §§ 16-1-7 and 16-1-8.\n\nThe trial court denied the motion and Bates appeals.\n\n      “The doctrine of double jeopardy has two components: the ‘procedural’ bar\n\non double jeopardy, which places limitations on multiple prosecutions for crimes\n\narising from the same conduct, and the ‘substantive’ bar, which protects against\n\nmultiple convictions or punishments for such crimes.” (Citation and punctuation\n\nomitted.) Williams v. State, 307 Ga. 778, 779 (1) (838 SE2d 235) (2020). Under the\n\nprocedural double jeopardy provisions of\n\n      OCGA § 16-1-7 (b), if several crimes (1) arising from the same conduct\n      are (2) known to the proper prosecuting officer at the time of\n      commencing the prosecution and are (3) within the jurisdiction of a\n      single court, they must be prosecuted in a single prosecution. A second\n      prosecution is barred under OCGA § 16-1-8 (b) (1) if it is for crimes\n      which should have been brought in the first prosecution under OCGA §\n      16-1-7 (b). In order for this procedural aspect of double jeopardy to\n      prohibit a prosecution, all three prongs must be satisfied.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Mathis v. State, 367 Ga. App. 588, 592-593 (2) (b)\n\n(887 SE2d 664) (2023).\n\n      Offenses occur as a result of the same conduct and therefore constitute\n      procedural double jeopardy, if the crimes arise from the same transaction\n      or continuing course of conduct, occur at the same scene, occur on the\n      same date, and occur without a break in the action; additionally, if it is\n      necessary to present evidence of the one crime in order to prove the\n      other, then the State must prosecute those charges at the same time.\n\n\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Daniels v. State, 355 Ga. App. 134, 136 (843 SE2d\n\n18) (2020). “The defendant bears the burden of proving procedural double jeopardy,\n\nand a court must make decisions based on the limited facts or representations that are\n\ncurrently available from the parties.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Mathis, 367\n\nGa. App. at 593 (2) (b).\n\n      As an initial matter, the State contends that there have not been multiple\n\nprosecutions of Bates pursuant to the definition of “prosecution” under OCGA § 16-\n\n1-3 (14), such that the protections of OCGA §§ 16-1-6 through 16-1-8 are triggered.\n\nWe agree.\n\n      In State v. Adams, 355 Ga. App. 875 (846 SE2d 148) (2020), this Court clarified\n\nthat “nothing in the plain language of OCGA § 16-1-8 predicates the application of its\n\n                                          4\n\fprovisions on the attachment of jeopardy. Rather, . . . the bar is established if an\n\naccused was ‘formerly prosecuted’ and, as previously discussed, the prosecution\n\nresulted in ‘either a conviction or an acquittal.’ See OCGA § 16-1-8 (b) (1), (c).” Id.\n\nat 880. We then pointed to the statutory definition of “prosecution” in OCGA §\n\n16-1-3 (14). Id. at 880-881. As used in Title 16, the term “‘[p]rosecution’ means all\n\nlegal proceedings by which a person’s liability for a crime is determined, commencing\n\nwith the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation, and including the final\n\ndisposition of the case upon appeal.” OCGA § 16-1-3 (14). Thus, “[p]rocedural\n\nprotections against double jeopardy apply only to ‘multiple prosecutions,’ meaning\n\nmultiple or successive indictments or criminal proceedings.” Williams, 307 Ga. at 779\n\n(1). As the State points out, no indictment, accusation, or juvenile court petition was\n\nfiled or returned regarding the original charges. Rather, the warrants were transferred\n\nto the juvenile court and then dismissed. See State v. Carlton, 276 Ga. 693, 696 (583\n\nSE2d 1) (2003) (“There is no question that in this State one cannot be tried upon an\n\narrest warrant.”). Accordingly, the procedural bar on double jeopardy does not apply,\n\nand the superior court properly denied Bates’ plea in bar.\n\n      Judgment affirmed. Barnes, P. J., and Mercier, J., concur.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f"}

YOUNG v. THE STATE.\n\n      MARKLE, Judge.\n\n      After Maurice Young pled guilty to rape, aggravated sodomy, and aggravated\n\nassault, the trial court denied his pro se motion for new trial, expressly declining to\n\nconsider it as a motion to withdraw the plea. He now appeals, arguing that (1) his plea\n\nwas not made knowingly and voluntarily because he was denied his right to self-\n\nrepresentation, there were improper communications between the prosecutor and a\n\njuror, and he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and (2) he was denied the right\n\nto withdraw his plea. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the trial court’s order, and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f       The record shows that Young was indicted for rape, aggravated sodomy, and\n\naggravated assault in connection with an incident in which he grabbed a young woman\n\nat a MARTA station, strangled her, forced her to perform oral sex, and vaginally\n\npenetrated her. Between January 2020 and July 2022,Young repeatedly filed motions\n\nseeking to discharge counsel and represent himself. Nothing in the record shows that\n\nthe trial court ever ruled on those motions or held a Faretta1 hearing to consider them.\n\n       In July 2023, Young proceeded to trial, but on the third day, he entered a\n\nnegotiated plea. The trial court explained to Young the rights he would be waiving by\n\npleading guilty, and Young indicated that he understood. Young further agreed that\n\nhe was entering his plea freely and voluntarily, and he waived his right to withdraw his\n\nplea before sentencing. The trial court made no mention of the rights or limitations\n\nto withdraw a plea after sentencing.\n\n       The trial court accepted Young’s plea to all three counts. Thereafter, Young\n\nfiled a pro se motion for new trial, arguing, inter alia, that his plea was involuntary due\n\nto ineffective assistance of counsel and the denial of his motion to represent himself.2\n\n\n       1\n           Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (95 SCt 2525, 45 LE2d 562) (1975).\n       2\n       The record does not contain any order discharging Young’s attorney before\nYoung filed his pro se motion. Nevertheless, the trial court accepted the pro se filing.\n                                            2\n\fThe trial court denied the motion, noting that a motion for new trial is not an available\n\nremedy following a guilty plea, and it declined to construe the motion as one seeking\n\nto withdraw the plea. This appeal followed.\n\n      1. We first consider Young’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because\n\nthat issue is dispositive of this appeal. Young argues that he received ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel because his attorney failed to challenge the prosecutor’s\n\ninappropriate contact with a juror; advised him to plead guilty; and failed to inform\n\nhim that he could seek to withdraw his plea, and that his plea would waive any\n\nchallenge to the denial of his right to self-representation. He contends that he would\n\nnot have entered his plea but for counsel’s deficient performance.\n\n      To begin, Young has preserved his claim by raising it at his first opportunity.\n\nSee Caskey v. State, 370 Ga. App. 697, 701 (2) (898 SE2d 867) (2024).\n\n      Generally, when the appeal presents the earliest practicable opportunity\n      to raise an ineffectiveness claim, and the claim is indeed raised for the\n\n\nSee Johnson v. State, 315 Ga. 876, 877 (885 SE2d 725) (2023) (trial court has\ndiscretion to consider pro se motion filed while defendant is still represented by\ncounsel); see also Sanchez v. State, 359 Ga. App. 667, 668 (859 SE2d 824) (2021)\n(given that defendant alleged counsel coerced him into entering plea, it was\n“unreasonable” to consider defendant as if still represented by counsel when he filed\nhis pro se motion).\n                                            3\n\f      first time on appeal, our appellate courts remand the case to the trial\n      court for an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Remand is not mandated\n      if we can determine from the record that the defendant cannot establish\n      ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test set forth in\n      Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\n      (1984). . . . A defendant who seeks to overturn a plea conviction because\n      of counsel’s errors must show both that counsel’s performance was\n      deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\n      errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on\n      going to trial. When considering claims for ineffective assistance of\n      counsel, this Court accepts the trial court’s factual findings and\n      credibility determinations unless clearly erroneous, but we\n      independently apply the legal principles to the facts.\n\n\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Caskey, 370 Ga. App. at 701 (2).\n\n      Here, Young entered a plea and there were no post-trial proceedings at which\n\nhe was able to develop a record to support his ineffective assistance claim. Young\n\nargues in his brief that counsel’s alleged deficient performance affected his decision\n\nto plead guilty, and that he would not have done so but for counsel’s actions. Because\n\nthis claim has not been properly addressed, and we cannot determine from the record\n\nthat it would be unsuccessful, we must vacate the trial court’s order, and remand the\n\ncase for an evidentiary hearing. Caskey, 370 Ga. App. at 701 (2).\n\n\n                                           4\n\f       2. Young next argues that the trial court erred by failing to construe his motion\n\nfor new trial as one to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n       In his motion for new trial, Young argued that he entered a plea because he\n\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel. But, the trial court refused to treat Young’s\n\nmotion as a motion to withdraw a plea because Young had not used that specific\n\nlanguage. Importantly, “[w]e consider the substance of a motion and not its\n\nnomenclature.” Martin v. State, 369 Ga. App. 193, 196 (2) (892 SE2d 826) (2023); see\n\nalso Galbreath v. State, 130 Ga. App. 179 (202 SE2d 562) (1973) (considering\n\nsubstance of pro se motion). And Young’s allegations that he “took a negotiated plea\n\nof guilty due to ineffective assistance of counsel,” and that he was “forced to go to\n\ntrial with court appointed counsel against his will and in violation of his Constitutional\n\nrights,” were sufficient to alert the trial court that he was seeking to withdraw his plea.\n\nSee, e. g., Ricks v. State, 307 Ga. 168 (835 SE2d 179) (2019) (treating pro se motion in\n\nwhich defendant argued her plea was involuntary and that she received ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel as one to withdraw plea), overruled on other grounds by Johnson\n\nv. State, 315 Ga. 876 (885 Se2d 725) (2023); Galbreath, 130 Ga. App. at 179\n\n(“Recognizing that substance and not mere nomenclature controls in a situation of\n\n\n                                            5\n\fthis sort, we consider the motion as one to withdraw the plea of guilty.”). As a result,\n\nthe trial court should have treated Young’s motion as one seeking to withdraw his plea\n\nafter sentencing.\n\n      It is well settled that, after sentencing, “a defendant may withdraw his guilty\n\nplea only to correct a ‘manifest injustice.’” Espinosa v. State, 320 Ga. 98, 102 (2) (907\n\nSE2d 691) (2024). Notably, “[t]hat standard is met if a defend"}

(Los Angeles County)\n\n\n THE PEOPLE,\n\n      Plaintiff and Respondent,\n\n v.\n\n J.C.,\n\n      Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         J.C. appeals from an order adjudicating him a ward of the\ncourt (Welf. & Inst. Code,1 § 602) after he pleaded no contest to\nfirst degree murder (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a)). The juvenile\ncourt committed J.C. to a secure youth treatment facility (SYTF)\n\n         1 Further unspecified statutory references are to the\nWelfare and Institutions Code.\n\ffor a baseline term of five years. On appeal, J.C. contends the\njuvenile court erred in committing him to an SYTF, the\nmaximum term of confinement must be modified, the degree of\nmurder was not specified and must be reduced to second degree\nmurder, his precommitment custody credits were incorrect, and\nthe restitution fine must be stricken. We modify the disposition\norder to correct the precommitment custody credits and strike the\nrestitution fine. In all other respects, we affirm.\n             FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2\n       In May 2022, J.C., M.E., and their cohorts committed a\nrobbery at a marijuana farm. J.C., who was then 16 years old,\nand his older brother, S.C., were the youngest in the group. The\ngroup traveled from Los Angeles County to Riverside County and\nrented a home for one night for the robbery. Each was armed\nwith a firearm. They wore masks and had zip ties and two-way\nradios.\n       Around 4:00 am, some of the perpetrators, including J.C.,\nbanged on the front door of the main trailer and announced they\nwere “DEA agents” before forcing entry. One of the participants\nhit a resident in the face with his rifle and held him at gunpoint.\nAnother participant forced another resident to the living room\nfloor and attempted to zip tie his hands. Two participants\nconfronted a third resident and one of them hit the resident’s\nhead with a firearm.\n       M.E. was shot in the thigh by one of his coparticipants.\nThe bullet hit his femoral artery. After the gunshot, J.C. ran into\na bedroom to retrieve a PlayStation 4 gaming console before\n\n\n\n      2 Because J.C. pleaded no contest, the facts are taken from\nthe probation reports.\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\ffleeing the scene of the crime. The participants left in their\nvehicles, and M.E. died on the drive back to the rental home.\n       The police interviewed Edgar Gonzalez-Navarro, who\nadmitted his participation in the robbery. He said J.C. was in the\nmain trailer with him, but left the room to help another\ncoparticipant. He then heard “several gunshots.” When\nGonzalez-Navarro returned to the car, J.C. said he “ ‘let some\nrounds off.’ ” Gonzalez-Navarro dumped M.E.’s body off the side\nof a road.\n       After the robbery, J.C. sold the stolen PlayStation 4 to a\nthird party through an online platform. Law enforcement\nreviewed J.C. and S.C.’s social media accounts. There were\nmessages between J.C. and S.C. about the sale of the PlayStation\n4. Based on information from these accounts, a gang enforcement\nofficer believed that J.C. and S.C. were members of the Drew\nStreet clique within the Avenues criminal street gang.\n       J.C. and S.C. were arrested at their home. While S.C. was\nin the holding cell, he identified himself as an associate of the\nAvenues Street gang Drew Street clique. He said he and J.C.\nwere recruited for the robbery. S.C. was armed with a pistol and\nforced entry into a “ ‘little cabin’ ” on the property where a mother\nand four children were inside. J.C., M.E., Gonzalez-Navarro, and\nanother person went to the main trailer. There was an\naltercation, and two participants fired their weapons. S.C. said\n“ ‘one of the fools shot, and they thought they shot at us, and I\nguess they hit the homie.’ ” Gonzalez-Navarro had the idea to\ndump M.E.’s body. S.C. and J.C. left after the robbery to return\nto Los Angeles County. J.C. later told S.C. that he shot one\nround during the altercation.\n       The section 602 petition alleged that J.C. willfully and\nunlawfully committed murder (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a); count\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\f1), was a principal in that crime and that someone who was a\nprincipal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm and\nproximately cause great bodily injury and death (Pen. Code\n§ 12022.53, subds. (d) & (e)). The petition also alleged J.C.\ncommitted robbery of an inhabited dwelling (Pen. Code, § 211;\ncount 2), burglary (Pen. Code, § 459; count 3), and robbery (Pen.\nCode, § 211; count 4). For counts 2 through 4, it was alleged that\nJ.C. committed the crimes for the benefit of a criminal street\ngang (Pen. Code, § 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(B)). The juvenile court\ndenied the district attorney’s motion to transfer J.C. to an adult\ncriminal court.\n       J.C. admitted a violation of Penal Code section 187,\nsubdivision (a), a felony. The juvenile court dismissed the\nremaining counts and the firearm and gang allegations.\nThereafter, the case was transferred from Riverside County\nSuperior Court to Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n       At the disposition hearing, the juvenile court declared J.C.\nto be a ward of the court under section 602 and ordered him\ncommitted to an SYTF with a baseline term of five years and a\nmaximum confinement term of 25 years to life. The court ordered\nJ.C. to pay victim restitution and a restitution fine of $100.\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                 SYTF\n       J.C. contends the juvenile court erred in committing him to\nan SYTF because the evidence did not support its finding that an\nSYTF met his needs. We disagree.\n       “ ‘ “We review a juvenile court’s commitment decision for\nabuse of discretion, indulging all reasonable inferences to support\nits decision.” [Citation.] “ ‘[D]iscretion is abused whenever the\ncourt exceeds the bounds of all reason, all of the circumstances\nbeing considered.’ ” [Citation.] We will not disturb the juvenile\n\n\n\n                                4\n\fcourt’s findings when there is substantial evidence to support\nthem. [Citation.] “ ‘In determining whether there was\nsubstantial evidence to support the commitment, we must\nexamine the record presented at the disposition hearing in light\nof the purposes of the Juvenile Court Law.’ ” ’ [Citation.] ‘A trial\ncourt abuses its discretion when the factual findings critical to its\ndecision find no support in the evidence.’ ” (In re Khalid B. (2015)\n233 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1288.)\n       Pursuant to section 875, subdivision (a), a court may order\na ward who is 14 years of age or older to be committed to an\nSYTF if they meet the following criteria: (1) They are found to be\na ward of the court based on an offense listed in Section 707,\nsubdivision (b) that was committed when they were 14 years of\nage or older, (2) the adjudication is their most recent offense, and\n(3) the court has made a finding on the record that a “less\nrestrictive, alternative disposition” for the ward is unsuitable.\n       The third criteria is at issue here. In making this finding,\nthe juvenile court “shall consider all relevant and material\nevidence, including the recommendations of counsel, the\nprobation department, and any other agency . . . . The court shall\nadditionally make its determination based on all of the following\ncri"}

Ct. No. CV-416920)\n\n           Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n         Jimmy Kashanian is the named plaintiff in a consumer class action\nagainst National Enterprise Systems, Inc. (National Enterprise). The action\nalleges National Enterprise violated the Consumer Collection Notice law\n(Civ. Code, § 1812.700 et seq.; Collection Notice law; undesignated statutory\nreferences are to this code) and the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices\nAct (§ 1788 et seq.; Rosenthal Act) by providing consumer debt collection\nnotices that fail to conform to requirements concerning type size. The action\nseeks statutory damages under the Rosenthal Act. The trial court granted\nsummary judgment to National Enterprise after determining Kashanian\nfailed to allege any actual injury and thus lacked standing to pursue\nstatutory damages. On appeal, Kashanian argues that standing for a\nplaintiff seeking statutory damages under the Collection Notice law and\n\n\n\n                                                               1\n\fRosenthal Act arises from a debt collector’s violation of those statutes, not\nfrom the plaintiff’s suffering of actual injury. We agree and reverse.\n                               BACKGROUND\n      Kashanian defaulted on credit payments, and his debt was assigned to\nthird party debt collector National Enterprise. National Enterprise sent\nKashanian a collection letter containing mandatory language — notifying\nhim of rights as a debtor under state and federal law — in eight-point type,\nsmaller than the type size used to inform him of his specific debt.1\n      Kashanian filed an amended complaint on behalf of himself and a\nproposed class alleging the collection notices failed to comply with the type-\nsize requirements — use of at least the same type size used to inform him of\nhis specific debt — in the Collection Notice law, and hence violated the\nRosenthal Act. (§§ 1812.701, subd. (b), 1812.702.) He sought statutory\ndamages, attorney fees and costs, and an order enjoining National Enterprise\nfrom violating the Collection Notice law.\n      National Enterprise moved for summary judgment, arguing Kashanian\nand the class lacked standing because of a failure to allege or demonstrate\nany actual injury resulting from the noncompliant notice. The trial court\n\n      1 Third party debt collectors must send a notice containing the\n\nfollowing language: “The state Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\nand the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act require that, except under\nunusual circumstances, collectors may not contact you before 8 a.m. or after 9\np.m. They may not harass you by using threats of violence or arrest or by\nusing obscene language. Collectors may not use false or misleading\nstatements or call you at work if they know or have reason to know that you\nmay not receive personal calls at work. For the most part, collectors may not\ntell another person, other than your attorney or spouse, about your debt.\nCollectors may contact another person to confirm your location or enforce a\njudgment. For more information about debt collection activities, you may\ncontact the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP or www.ftc.gov.”\n(§ 1812.700, subd. (a).)\n\n                                        2\n\fagreed. It acknowledged that failing to provide collection notices using\nprescribed type size, as here, violates the Rosenthal Act. But it concluded\ncivil liability under 15 U.S.C. section 1692k (section 1692k) — the federal\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA; 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.)\nprovision that the Rosenthal Act incorporates — cannot be imposed when\nthere is no alleged harm, injury, or loss, or reasonably foreseeable risk of\nharm, injury, or loss due to the violation. The court reasoned that damages\nare “compensation derivative for an underlying injury, harm, or loss and not\nsimply based on the fact of a violation.” Because Kashanian and the class did\nnot allege or demonstrate any actual impacts from the violation of type-size\nrequirements, they lacked standing to pursue damages. The court granted\nNational Enterprise’s motion for summary judgment.\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      Kashanian contends the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment because standing under the Rosenthal Act arises from National\nEnterprise’s statutory violations rather than from the resulting actual injury.\nWe agree.\n      A trial court must grant summary judgment if the moving party shows\nthere are no triable issues of material fact and they are entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. (Duffey v. Tender Heart Home Care Agency, LLC (2019)\n31 Cal.App.5th 232, 240–241; Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subds. (a), (c).)\nDefendants may obtain summary judgment “by showing . . . the plaintiff\nlacks standing,” “a fatal jurisdictional defect that requires judgment against\nthe plaintiff.” (Lickter v. Lickter (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 712, 736; Scott v.\nThompson (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1510.) Standing “ensures that\n‘courts will decide only actual controversies between parties with a sufficient\ninterest in the subject matter of the dispute to press their case with vigor.’ ”\n\n\n                                        3\n\f(Kim v. Reins International California, Inc. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 73, 83 (Kim).)\nInfringement of a statutory right “may qualify as a legitimate claim of\nbeneficial interest sufficient to confer standing” on a party. (Holmes v.\nCalifornia Nat. Guard (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 297, 314–315.) Whether a\nstatutory provision confers standing is a question of law. (Neil S. v. Mary L.\n(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 240, 249.) When interpreting a statute, we give its\nwords their plain, ordinary meaning and consider them in the context of the\nentire statutory framework to effectuate the Legislature’s purpose. (Kim,\nat p. 83.) We independently review a summary judgment ruling and issues of\nstatutory construction. (Regents of University of California v. Superior Court\n(1999) 20 Cal.4th 509, 531.)\n      Under the Collection Notice law, third party debt collectors must\nprovide debtors a notice informing them of certain rights. (§ 1812.700,\nsubd. (a).) Violations of that law also constitute violations of the Rosenthal\nAct. (§ 1812.702.) In turn, that act requires debt collectors to comply with\ncertain provisions of the FDCPA. (§ 1788.17 [“every debt collector collecting\nor attempting to collect a consumer debt shall comply with the provisions of\n[15 U.S.C.] Sections 1692b to 1692j”]; 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.) The\nRosenthal Act also imposes liability for violations. (See, e.g., § 1788.30,\nsubds. (a)–(b).)2 Relevant here, debt collectors are subject “to the remedies in\nSection 1692k.” (§ 1788.17; Timlick v. National Enterprise Systems, Inc.\n(2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 674, 681; Alkan v. Citimortgage, Inc. (N.D.Cal. 2004)\n\n      2 Although not at issue here, section 1788.30, subdivision (a) makes\n\ndebt collectors who violate the Rosenthal Act liable to the debtor “in an\namount equal to the sum of any actual damages sustained by the debtor as a\nresult of the violation.” Debt collectors who willfully and knowingly violate\nthe act are liab"}

Ct. No. 02F06389)\n\n           v.\n\n FRED DALE BECK,\n\n                    Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         Defendant Fred Dale Beck appeals from an order denying his petition for\nresentencing of his attempted murder conviction under Penal Code section 1172.6.\nAppointed counsel for defendant asks this court to conduct an independent review of the\nrecord to determine whether there are any arguable issues on appeal, and defendant has\nfiled a supplemental brief. (People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436; People v. Delgadillo\n(2022) 14 Cal.5th 216.) We have reviewed defendant’s supplemental brief. The\ncontentions he raises are not cognizable on appeal because they rely on information\noutside the appellate record. We therefore affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                                   1\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n       In 2003, a jury found defendant guilty of premeditated and deliberate attempted\nmurder, corporal injury on a spouse, and assault with a deadly weapon, with an\nenhancement as to all three counts that defendant inflicted great bodily injury under\ncircumstances involving domestic violence.\n       In 2005, this court affirmed defendant’s conviction. (People v. Beck (April 28,\n2005, C045913) [nonpub. opn.].)\n       In December 2023, defendant filed a petition for resentencing. The court\nappointed counsel, the People filed a response, and defendant filed a reply.\n       On May 2, 2024, the trial court issued a written order denying the petition. The\ncourt stated it had reviewed the petition, case law, CALJIC jury instructions from the\nrelevant time period, and other materials. The trial court found that the jury convicted\ndefendant of attempted murder without considering the natural and probable\nconsequences doctrine because the trial court did not instruct the jury on the doctrine.\nThe trial court concluded defendant was not eligible for relief as a matter of law.\n       Defendant appeals.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Our Supreme Court has considered whether the Wende process applies to a trial\ncourt’s order denying a petition for postconviction relief under section 1172.6 and\nconcluded such procedures are not required. (People v. Delgadillo, supra, 14 Cal.5th at\npp. 221-222.) Our Supreme Court laid out applicable procedures for such cases saying,\nwhere, as here, a defendant has filed a supplemental brief, “the Court of Appeal is\nrequired to evaluate the specific arguments presented in [the] brief and to issue a written\nopinion. The filing of a supplemental brief or letter does not compel an independent\nreview of the entire record to identify unraised issues.” (Id. at p. 232.)\n       In his supplemental brief, defendant contends that during the pendency of his\ndirect appeal he learned that a witness for the prosecution had been dating and later\n\n                                                  2\n\fmarried a correctional officer who had intercepted defendant’s mail and communications\nwhen defendant was incarcerated in the county jail. Defendant contends this conduct,\nwhich was improper and kept secret, would have affected the jury’s impression of the\nwitness. Defendant also relates that his family members observed the prosecutor\ncoaching this witness, but defense counsel admonished defendant to tell defendant’s\nfamily to refrain from talking to defendant’s defense counsel. Finally, defendant notes\nthat a witness who testified against him was prosecuted for defrauding defendant and\nothers and served a lengthy sentence in federal prison.\n       Defendant’s contentions are not cognizable on appeal because they rely on\ninformation outside the appellate record. (Schmier v. Supreme Court (2000)\n78 Cal.App.4th 703, 711-712.)\n       Having addressed the specific contentions raised in defendant’s supplemental\nbrief, our review is complete. (People v. Delgadillo, supra, 14 Cal.5th at p. 232.)\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The trial court’s order denying defendant’s petition for resentencing is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                  /s/\n                                                 MESIWALA, J.\n\n\n       We concur:\n\n\n\n\n       HULL, Acting P.

Affirmed.\n         Christian C. Buckley, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for\nDefendant and Appellant.\n         No appearance for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n         Taurino Jose Santos appeals from a judgment following bench trial\nrecommitting him as an offender with mental health disorder (OMHD) under\n\fPenal Code sections 2970 and 2972.1 His counsel submitted a brief pursuant\nto Conservatorship of Ben C. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 529 (Ben C.) and People v.\nTaylor (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 304, stating he found no arguable issues on\nappeal. He urged this court to conduct an independent review of the record\nunder People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436. We granted Santos the\nopportunity to file a supplemental brief on his own behalf and he has not\ndone so. As explained below, we conclude there is no reversible error and\ntherefore affirm the order.\n              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      In 2018, Santos pled guilty to one count of felonious assault by means\nlikely to produce great bodily injury. (§ 245, subd. (a)(4).) The court\nsentenced Santos to a total prison term of eight years.\n      In 2022, Santos was committed to the Department of State Hospitals as\nan OMHD under section 2962. In 2024, prior to Santos’s parole termination\ndate, the People sought a one-year extension of Santos’s commitment under\nsections 2970 and 2972. In support of the April 2024 petition, the People\nattached an affidavit from the medical director of a state hospital. The\nmedical director opined that Santos’s severe mental disorder was not in\nremission and necessitated continued treatment under section 2970. A\npsychologist working at the state hospital confirmed the medical director’s\nopinion, detailing Santos’s Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type.\n      Santos denied the allegations in the petition and requested a bench\ntrial. The court appointed two doctors to examine Santos and provide\nopinions about whether his commitment should be extended. Both doctors\n\n\n1     Further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\nOMHD prisoners were previously referred to as mentally disordered\noffenders or MDOs, but the Legislature changed the terminology in 2019.\n(People v. McCray (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 260, 264, fn. 1.)\n                                       2\n\fagreed that Santos suffered from a severe mental disorder. In contravention\nof the majority opinion, one of the examining doctors believed Santos’s\nsymptoms of Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, to be in remission.\nHowever, all three doctors opined that Santos remained a danger and\nrecommended recommitment to a state hospital. They cited a series of\noutbursts in the preceding year and a history of relapses. Finally, Santos\ntestified, asserting his symptoms were controlled and he participated in a\nvariety of supportive programs. He described his medication as helpful, but\nadmitted to getting in a series of fights at the hospital. Santos described a\nplan to access care and requested release.\n      Ultimately, the court determined the petition’s allegations were true\nand recommitted Santos to the Department of State Hospitals for an\nadditional one year term, until August 11, 2025.\n                                DISCUSSION\n      Santos’s appointed counsel filed a brief under the authority of Wende,\nsupra, 25 Cal.3d 436, setting forth a statement of the case and a summary of\nthe facts and procedural history. Counsel raised no specific issues on appeal,\nurging this court to conduct an independent review of the record pursuant to\nBen C., supra.

Proc.,1 § 527.6) that Denise Webb filed against Paul Alexander.\n\n\n1    Further unspecified statutory references are to the Code of Civil\nProcedure.\n\fFollowing the evidentiary hearing on the petition, Alexander filed an anti-\n\nSLAPP2 special motion to strike the petition pursuant to section 425.16. The\ntrial court denied his motion, and Alexander contends this was error. We\ndisagree with him, and so we affirm.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                          I.\n                           Restraining Order Proceedings\n          On October 16, 2023, Webb filed her petition against Alexander using\n\nthe standard Judicial Council CH-100 form.3 She asserted that he was a\nformer tenant who had been involved with her in other court cases. She\nsought protection for herself as well as several family members, stating she\n“fear[ed] for their safety.”\n          In two attachments, Webb described how Alexander had harassed her.\nIn the first attachment, she stated: “Paul Alexander is the CEO of Pillars of\nthe Community. He is aware of the threatening & misconduct of his\nemployees and is encouraging it instead of telling them to leave us alone. His\nparolees keep vandalizing my building, breaking windows, [b]reaking my\ncameras, gra[ffiti] my building in retaliation of the eviction paperwork I\nfiled.”\n          In the second attachment, she set forth the following six paragraphs:\n“By way of history I purchased a property in July of 2021. Mr. Paul\nAlexander and La[i]la Azziz of the Pillars of the Community program were\n\n2     SLAPP is an acronym that stands for strategic lawsuit against public\nparticipation.\n\n3     Webb represented herself throughout the restraining order\nproceedings, but she retained counsel to represent her after Alexander filed\nhis anti-SLAPP motion.\n\n                                          2\n\ftenants in the building I purchased. Upon taking over this building there\nwere items in the lease that the parties were not following, as a result I filed\nto have their tenancy terminated. Subsequently they countersued personally\nand thus began the harassment. The original lawsuit was granted . . . . I\nappealed this decision because I was never properly served.\n      “As a business owner I have an address that is listed as my agency of\nservice. Based on their initial service of their lawsuit being served at the\nincorrect address, it was subsequently thrown out in court. Now they have\nfiled a second lawsuit and in ‘attempt to serve me’ are going to all of my listed\nproperties, despite being provided with my service address at the last court\nhearing.\n      “On Monday October 2, 2023 Mr. Alexander and his attorney Cory\nBriggs[ ] sent a very aggressive man from their program[ ] to one of my rental\nproperties. Despite being given my address of service, this gentleman\nknocked on the front door of my tenant and demanded information. He asked\nher did I live there, did she know where I lived, and where did she send her\nrental payments to, what is her relationship to me. Frightened by this\ncomplete stranger on her door step, she called her son who verbally\ndemanded this person leave. My tenant called me very shaken up and scared\nby this harassment.\n      “On October 4, 2023 at a different rental property two gentlemen\napproached a different tenant and began to harass him with the same\nquestions regarding my address, where he sent his rental payments to[ ], and\nany information he could provide as to my whereabouts.\n      “I am a single woman with multiple properties[;] Pillars of the\nCommunity is a program created for ex-prisoners, gang members and former\ndrug addicts. I believe Mr. Alexander and his staff listed above is sending\n\n\n                                        3\n\fthese men in their program to harass my tenants, as well as [in] an attempt\nto scare me into dropping the lawsuit. There have been multiple acts of\nvandalism to my properties[,] broken windows, unlawful loitering on the\npremises.\n      “As such I am requesting an Order of Protection from Mr. Paul\nAlexander, La[i]la Azziz, and any other person employed or associated with\nthe Pillars of the Community.”\n      The trial court issued a temporary restraining order pending a hearing\non the petition. The hearing, which was unreported, went forward on\nDecember 5, 2023, before Judge James A. Mangione. Webb was\nunrepresented; Alexander was represented by attorney Cory Briggs. Webb\nand Alexander testified, as did several other witnesses. After considering the\nparties’ presentations, the court found Webb failed to prove her case by clear\nand convincing evidence. It dissolved the temporary restraining order,\ndenied Webb’s request for injunction, and ordered that any costs or attorney\nfees would be subject to further motion.\n                                      II.\n                           Anti-SLAPP Proceedings\nA.    Alexander’s Motion\n      On December 11, 2023, Alexander filed an ex parte application for\npermission to schedule an anti-SLAPP motion in lieu of a motion for an\naward of attorney fees. In a supporting declaration, Briggs averred that he\nhad “e-filed” an anti-SLAPP motion “[p]rior to” the December 5 evidentiary\nhearing only to learn later that it was rejected because such motions are not\n\npermitted in restraining order cases.4 (Italics added.) Briggs stated the\n\n\n4     Contrary to this averment, the filed and rejected anti-SLAPP motion\nwithin the record on appeal bears a December 6 file stamp that was\n                                       4\n\frejection was erroneous because although an application for temporary\nrestraining order is not subject to an anti-SLAPP motion, a petition for an\ninjunction against civil harassment is. A different judge granted the\napplication and approved the filing of the anti-SLAPP motion.\n      Alexander’s operative anti-SLAPP motion was then filed on December\n12, 2023. The motion was labeled as a “special motion to strike petitioner’s\nrequest for civil harassment restraining order.” (Capitalization and boldface\nomitted.) In his notice of motion and five-page supporting memorandum,\nAlexander requested the trial court to strike Webb’s petition in its entirety.\nHe stated Webb filed her petition (which he referred to as a “lawsuit”) in\nretaliation for a lawsuit he filed against her.

On the day she returned,\nTCU informed her that she would be terminated. Holland alleges she was\nterminated in retaliation for taking FMLA leave. TCU asserts it terminated\nHolland because various problems with her performance became apparent\nwhile she was on leave. After her termination, Holland sued TCU in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, bringing a\nsingle count she labeled as FMLA discrimination, interference, and\nretaliation. The district court granted TCU’s motion for summary judgment,\ndismissing Holland’s claims with prejudice.\n                                       II\n       We review a court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Lawrence v.\nFed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 808 F.3d 670, 673 (5th Cir. 2015). Summary\njudgment is required “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “A non-movant will not avoid summary\njudgment    by    presenting    ‘speculation,    improbable    inferences,   or\nunsubstantiated assertions.’” Lawrence, 808 F.3d at 673 (quoting Likens v.\nHartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 688 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 2012)).\n                                      III\n       Generally, to establish a prima facie case of FMLA interference,\ndiscrimination, or retaliation, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that\nshe was entitled to leave. See Caldwell v. KHOU-TV, 850 F.3d 237, 245 (5th\nCir. 2017) (interference); Bocalbos v. Nat’l W. Life Ins. Co., 162 F.3d 379, 383\n(5th Cir. 1998) (discrimination and retaliation). One of the ways an employee\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f Case: 25-10567           Document: 31-1          Page: 3       Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 25-10567\n\n\ncan be entitled to leave is “[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes\nthe employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such\nemployee.” 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). The district court correctly held that\nHolland’s FMLA claim failed as a matter of law because Holland did not\ndemonstrate that she was entitled to FMLA leave. Both Holland and her\ndoctor agreed that she was never unable to perform the functions of her\nposition. Therefore, Holland cannot establish her entitlement for leave under\n§ 2612(a)(1)(D). See Ford-Evans v. United Space All. LLC, 329 F. App’x 519,\n527 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (affirming employee ineligibility where she\n“admitted in testimony that she was able to do the essential functions of her\nposition at all material times”); Murray v. Red Kap Indus., Inc., 124 F.3d 695,\n699 (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming ineligibility where plaintiff provided no\nevidence he was “unable to work”).1\n        Even where an employee is not entitled to FMLA leave, an employer\nmay be estopped from asserting non-entitlement as a defense if the employer\nrepresented to the employee that she was eligible, had reason to believe the\n\n        _____________________\n        1\n            On appeal, Holland alternatively argues for the first time that her chronic\ndepression qualified as a “chronic serious health condition” which entitled her to leave. 29\nC.F.R. § 825.115(c) defines a serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a\nhealth care provider to include “[a]ny period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity\ndue to a chronic serious health condition.” Holland has likely forfeited this argument by\nfailing to raise it below. See Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir. 2002). Regardless,\nHolland’s argument under § 825.115(c) fails for similar reasons: She has presented no\nevidence that she was incapacitated or substantially limited in her ability to work. See 29\nC.F.R. § 825.113(b) (“The term incapacity means inability to work, attend school or\nperform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment\ntherefore, or recovery therefrom.”). Holland testified as to her ongoing ability to both work\nand “at least moderately function in normal life activities” including practicing self-care,\nmaintaining social relationships, driving, and advertising a property for rent. And the cases\nHolland cites are of no help. See Ladner v. Hancock Med. Ctr., 299 F. App’x 380, 381 (5th\nCir. 2008) (per curiam) (upholding jury determination that asthma qualified as “serious\nhealth condition” where sufferer “was unable to perform his regular daily activities”).\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fCase: 25-10567        Document: 31-1       Page: 4    Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 25-10567\n\n\nemployee would rely on that representation, and the employee reasonably\nrelied on that representation to her detriment. Minard v. ITC Deltacom\nCommc’ns, Inc., 447 F.3d 352, 359 (5th Cir. 2006). The district court also\ncorrectly found that Holland failed to present evidence that she detrimentally\nrelied on TCU’s representation that she was eligible for leave. Instead,\nHolland testified that she would have taken the full amount of leave\nregardless of TCU’s approval of her request. This proves fatal to her\nassertion of detrimental reliance. See Durose v. Grand Casino of Miss. Inc., 251\nF. App’x 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (distinguishing Minard to find\nno FMLA violation because the plaintiff did “not present[] any evidence that\nshe detrimentally relied on” her employer’s misrepresentation). Because\nHolland cannot establish that she was eligible for FMLA leave, nor that\nTCU is estopped from challenging that eligibility, she cannot establish a\nprima facie case of FMLA interference, discrimination, or retaliation.\n                             "}

See 5th Cir. R. 47.5.\n\fCase: 24-60655        Document: 40-1       Page: 2     Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 24-60655\n\n\n       Our court reviews the BIA’s decision and considers the IJ’s decision\nonly to the extent it influenced the BIA. Orellana-Monson v. Holder, 685 F.3d\n511, 517 (5th Cir. 2012). The BIA’s factual findings are reviewed for\nsubstantial evidence; its legal conclusions, de novo. Id. Findings of fact,\nincluding an applicant’s eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and\nrelief under CAT, are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.\nE.g., Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006). Under this\nstandard, our court will not disturb the BIA’s decision unless the evidence\n“compels” a contrary conclusion. E.g., Revencu v. Sessions, 895 F.3d 396, 401\n(5th Cir. 2018) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).\n       An alien seeking asylum or withholding of removal must show, inter\nalia, that officials are unable or unwilling to protect her from persecution on\naccount of a protected ground, such as membership in a particular social\ngroup. E.g., Jaco v. Garland, 24 F.4th 395, 402 (5th Cir. 2021). If an alien\nfails to establish any of the elements of asylum or withholding, her claim fails,\nand the court need not consider her contentions concerning the remaining\nelements. INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976); Munoz-De Zelaya v.\nGarland, 80 F.4th 689, 694 (5th Cir. 2023) (“[C]ourts and agencies are not\nrequired to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to\nthe results they reach.”).\n       Ramirez shows no error in the BIA’s conclusion that she waived any\ncontention she may have had to the IJ’s determination that she had not\nshown that Mexican officials were unable or unwilling to protect her. See\nLopez-Perez v. Garland, 35 F.4th 953, 957 n.1 (5th Cir. 2022) (unbriefed issues\nare abandoned). And because, as discussed supra, this is an essential element\nof claims for asylum and withholding of removal, Jaco, 24 F.4th at 401, 406–\n07, she shows no error in connection with the BIA’s rejection of these claims.\nE.g., Munoz-De Zelaya, 80 F.4th at 693–94; Santos-Alvarado v. Barr, 967 F.3d\n428, 440 n.13 (5th Cir. 2020).\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\fCase: 24-60655       Document: 40-1        Page: 3   Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 24-60655\n\n\n       Turning to Ramirez’ CAT contention, her assertions that gangs\nwould search for her should she return to Mexico, and that the police could\nnot protect her, does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA\nregarding whether she showed she more likely than not would be tortured\nwith official acquiescence if repatriated. E.g., Morales v. Sessions, 860 F.3d\n812, 818 (5th Cir. 2017); Zhang v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2005).\n       DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\f"}

Gregory Wilhite sued his insurer, Ark\nRoyal, even though the company had already paid him everything the policy\nrequired. Wilhite’s claims are foreclosed under binding circuit and Texas\nSupreme Court precedent. We therefore AFFIRM summary judgment for\nArk Royal.\n\n      _____________________\n      *\n          This opinion is not designated for publication. See 5th Cir. R. 47.5.\n\f Case: 24-20401         Document: 66-1          Page: 2     Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                       24-20401\n\n\n                                            I\n        In February 2021, Gregory Wilhite submitted a homeowners\ninsurance claim to Ark Royal for a burst water pipe. Over the next five\nmonths, Ark Royal conducted two inspections of the property and made\nseveral payments to Wilhite. Not satisfied, Wilhite invoked his policy’s\nappraisal provision. The appraisal award concluded in November 2021 with\na higher damages assessment. Consistent with the policy, Ark Royal paid\nWilhite the balance—plus statutory interest.\n        Nevertheless, Wilhite sued Ark Royal in state court. Ark Royal\nremoved the case to federal court, after which Wilhite filed an amended\ncomplaint asserting four claims: 1 (1) breach of contract; (2) violations of the\nTexas Prompt Payment of Claims Act (TPPCA); (3) breach of the common-\nlaw duty of good faith and fair dealing; and (4) violations of Chapter 541 of\nthe Texas Insurance Code (Unfair Methods of Competition and Unfair or\nDeceptive Acts or Practices).\n        Ark Royal moved for summary judgment on all claims. It argued that\nWilhite could not prevail because Ark Royal had already paid all amounts\nowed—including statutory interest—and Wilhite had not shown any\nindependent injury. In response, Wilhite conceded that his contract and\nTPPCA claims were not viable but argued that his two tort claims—under\ncommon law and Chapter 541—should proceed to trial. The district court\ndisagreed and granted summary judgment to Ark Royal on all claims.\n        This appeal followed.\n\n        _____________________\n        1\n           Wilhite also sued Progressive Property Insurance Company and American\nStrategic Insurance Corporation. But the district court later dismissed those defendants\nwithout prejudice, and Wilhite does not challenge that ruling on appeal. Accordingly, Ark\nRoyal is the sole defendant on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fCase: 24-20401         Document: 66-1        Page: 3   Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                    24-20401\n\n\n                                       II\n         We review summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard\nas the district court. Edwards v. City of Balch Springs, 70 F.4th 302, 307 (5th\nCir. 2023). Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is\nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “[I]n this diversity-\njurisdiction case, Texas law applies to . . . question[s] of substantive law.”\nAntero Res., Corp. v. C&R Downhole Drilling Inc., 85 F.4th 741, 746 (5th Cir.\n2023).\n\n                                       III\n         Wilhite maintains on appeal that his tort claims are viable. He\ncontends that under Texas law, an insured can recover for insurance-related\ntorts even when the insurer has already paid out the policy’s benefits. Ark\nRoyal disagrees. It argues that Wilhite’s argument is foreclosed by binding\nprecedent. Moreover, Ark Royal asserts that we lack jurisdiction over this\npurportedly untimely appeal.\n\n                                        A\n         We begin—as we must—with jurisdiction. See United States v.\nRodriguez, 33 F.4th 807, 811 (5th Cir. 2022) (“[C]ourts must assess their\njurisdiction before turning to the merits.”). Ark Royal contends that Wilhite\nfailed to timely file his notice of appeal—a jurisdictional prerequisite. See\nKinsley v. Lakeview Reg’l Med. Ctr. LLC, 570 F.3d 586, 588 (5th Cir. 2009)\n(“The filing of a timely notice of appeal, within thirty days after entry of the\ncourt’s judgment, is mandatory and jurisdictional.” (citing Bowles v. Russell,\n551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007))).\n         Under the federal rules, a party must file its notice of appeal “within\n30 days after entry of the judgment or order.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f Case: 24-20401         Document: 66-1          Page: 4      Date Filed: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n                                        24-20401\n\n\nBut the rules also permit a district court to extend that time if the party (1)\nrequests an extension within 30 days after the original 30 days expires (that\nis, within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order), and (2) shows\n“excusable neglect or good cause.” Id. at 4(a)(5)(A); see also Sudduth v. Tex.\nHealth & Hum. Servs. Comm’n, 830 F.3d 175, 178–79 (5th Cir. 2016). We\nreview a district court’s order on an extension request for abuse of discretion.\nStotter v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, 508 F.3d 812, 820 (5th Cir. 2007). And\nwhen the district court grants the extension—as opposed to denying it—we\nafford that decision even “more leeway.” Id.\n        Here, the district court entered its summary-judgment order on May\n30, 2024. So Wilhite had until July 1 to file his notice of appeal, 2 and until\nJuly 31 to seek an extension. He missed the notice-of-appeal deadline but\nsought an extension on July 24, 2024—within the time period permitted by\nRule 4(a)(5)(A). The district court granted an extension based on its finding\nof excusable neglect. Thus, the question before us is whether that finding was\nan abuse of discretion.\n        In deciding whether a party has shown excusable neglect, we have\nadopted the Supreme Court’s standard from Pioneer Investment Services Co.\nv. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993). See Halicki v. La.\nCasino Cruises, Inc., 151 F.3d 465, 468–69 (5th Cir. 1998) (applying Pioneer’s\nstandard to Rule 4(a)(5)). A determination of excusable neglect “is at bottom\nan equitable one.” Id. at 468 (quoting Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395). We must\nconsider all “relevant circumstances surrounding the party’s omission,”\nincluding: (1) “the danger of prejudice,” (2) “the length of the delay and its\npotential impact on judicial proceedings,” (3) “the reason for the delay,\n        _____________________\n        2\n         Thirty days from May 30 is actually June 29. But because June 29, 2024, fell on a\nSaturday, Wilhite had until the following Monday—July 1—to file his notice. See Fe"}

On appeal, Father argues\nthe family court (1) violated his right to due process by compelling him to testify at\nthe final hearing and (2) erred in terminating his parental rights on three statutory\ngrounds. We affirm.\n\n\"On appeal from the family court, the appellate court reviews factual and legal\nissues de novo.\" Klein v. Barrett, 427 S.C. 74, 79, 828 S.E.2d 773, 776 (Ct. App.\n2019). Under the de novo standard of review, this court may make its own\nfindings of fact; however, we continue to recognize the superior position of the\nfamily court to assess witness credibility. Stoney v. Stoney, 422 S.C. 593, 595, 813\nS.E.2d 486, 487 (2018). Moreover, de novo review does not relieve the appellant\nof the burden of showing that the preponderance of the evidence is against the\nfamily court's findings. Id.\n\nWe hold the family court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Father's\nobjection to testifying in the case in chief of the Department of Social Services\n(DSS). See id. at 594 n.2, 813 S.E.2d at 486 n.2 (explaining appellate courts\nreview the family court's procedural and evidentiary rulings for an abuse of the\nfamily court's discretion). During the combined removal and termination of\nparental rights (TPR) hearing, Father objected to being called to testify on due\nprocess grounds. We are unable to identify any authority suggesting this state has\nrecognized the right to avoid testifying as falling under the ambit of due process.\nSee S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705\n(1997) (\"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be\nheard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"). Accordingly, we hold\nthe family court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Father's objection.\n\nAs to the statutory grounds for TPR, we hold clear and convincing evidence\nshowed Father failed to remedy the conditions that caused Child's removal. See\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2024) (explaining the family court may order\nTPR upon finding a statutory ground for TPR is met and TPR is in the child's best\ninterest); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2620 (2010) (\"This article must be liberally\nconstrued in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children\nfrom the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child\nrelationship.\"); S.C.

State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 329 S.C. 371, 374 n.2, 496\nS.E.2d 17, 18 n.2 (1998))); § 63-7-2570(2) (explaining a statutory ground for TPR\nis met when \"[t]he child has been removed from the parent . . . and has been out of\nthe home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by\ncourt order or by agreement between [DSS] and the parent and the parent has not\nremedied the conditions which caused the removal\"). Child was first removed in\nNovember 2022, when Morgan Thacker (Mother) was arrested for drug possession\nand Father, who was incarcerated, was unable to assume care of Child. In the 2022\ncase, the family court found Father physically neglected Child and placed her at a\nsubstantial risk of physical abuse, ordered Father's name to be entered into the\nCentral Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect, and directed Father to complete a\nplacement plan. Mother completed a placement plan; Father, who remained\nincarcerated, did not, and in October 2023, the case closed with Mother regaining\ncustody of Child. The present action began in February 2024, when Child nearly\ndied after ingesting fentanyl. Throughout the case, Father remained incarcerated 1\nand, therefore, unable to care for Child. Accordingly, we hold this statutory\nground was met.\n\nWe hold clear and convincing evidence also showed Father had a diagnosable\ncondition that was unlikely to change within a reasonable time and made him\nunlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of Child. See § 63-7-2570(6)\n(explaining a statutory ground has been met when \"(i) the parent has a diagnosable\ncondition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to,\naddiction to alcohol or illegal drugs or prescription medication abuse; and (ii) the\ncondition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the\nchild\"); § 63-7-2570(6)(b) (\"It is presumed that the parent's condition is unlikely to\nchange within a reasonable time upon proof that the parent has been required by\n[DSS] or the family court to participate in a treatment program for alcohol or drug\naddiction, and the parent has failed two or more times to complete the program\nsuccessfully or has refused at two or more separate meetings with [DSS] to\nparticipate in a treatment program.\"). Father admitted to a decades-long history of\ndrug use—primarily methamphetamine—and stated he had twice sought substance\n\n1\n The record indicates Father was convicted of trafficking methamphetamine,\nsecond-degree burglary, and resisting an officer.\n\fabuse treatment \"on [his] own accord,\" which he failed to complete. Father\nasserted he had faced no problems with drug or alcohol since he became\nincarcerated, and he believed he \"[had his] drug problem under control.\" He\ntestified, however, that he had arranged to attend a ten-month rehabilitation\nprogram following his scheduled May 2025 release. Moreover, one of Mother's\nwitnesses, a bail bondsman who had known Mother and Father for at least six\nyears, described witnessing Father's \"rollercoaster of sobriety.\" She further\ntestified she believed Father was using drugs at the time he went to prison. Based\non Father's admitted \"drug problem,\" his extensive history of drug use, and the lack\nof evidence showing an ability to maintain sobriety outside his incarceration, we\nfind this ground was met. 2\n\nFinally, we find TPR is in Child's best interest.3 See S.C.

We affirm.\n\n       On January 28, 2014, Appellant pleaded guilty to three separate counts\n\nof receiving stolen property.1 On February 11, 2014, the trial court sentenced\n\nAppellant to serve an aggregate term of two to 14 years in prison for his\n\nconvictions. N.T. Sentencing, 2/11/14, at 5. Appellant filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal from his judgment of sentence. On November 12, 2014, however,\n\nthis Court dismissed Appellant’s appeal for failure to file a brief. See Order at\n\n385 MDA 2014, 11/12/14, at 1.\n\n       On July 9, 2015, the PCRA court reinstated Appellant’s direct appeal\n\nrights nunc pro tunc and Appellant’s counsel (hereinafter “Direct Appeal\n\nCounsel”) filed a timely notice of appeal. Nevertheless, on June 3, 2016, this\n\nCourt again dismissed Appellant’s appeal – this time because we found\n\n“substantial omissions and defects [in Appellant’s brief, which] preclude[d]\n\nmeaningful [appellate] review.” Commonwealth v. Angle, 153 A.3d 1098\n\n(Pa. Super. 2016) (unpublished memorandum), at *4 (hereinafter “the 2016\n\nAppeal”). Appellant did not file a petition for allowance of appeal with the\n\nPennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3925(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S26026-25\n\n\n\n        Eight years later, on July 18, 2024, Appellant filed a counseled PCRA\n\npetition. Within the petition, Appellant claimed that Direct Appeal Counsel\n\nwas ineffective for failing to file a competent brief in the 2016 Appeal. PCRA\n\nPetition, 7/18/24, at 4-7. Within the petition, Appellant acknowledged that\n\nhis petition was facially untimely under the PCRA, as it was filed beyond the\n\nPCRA’s one-year time-bar. Appellant contended, however, that his claim fell\n\nwithin the newly-discovered fact exception to the time-bar because: Direct\n\nAppeal Counsel told him that his direct appeal was denied on the merits;\n\nAppellant “was never made aware that his [direct] appeal was rejected due to\n\nprocedural flaws;” and, Appellant “just learned that his appeal was dismissed\n\ndue to [procedural] defects . . . [when] he was doing research on his current\n\ncase [and] found the Superior Court opinion explaining why his [direct] appeal\n\nwas really rejected.” Id. at 8. Appellant requested that the PCRA court grant\n\nhis petition and reinstate his direct appeal rights nunc pro tunc. Id. at 9.\n\n        On September 18, 2024, the PCRA court held a hearing on Appellant’s\n\npetition, where Appellant testified on his own behalf.2 During the hearing,\n\nAppellant testified that he was in federal custody when Direct Appeal Counsel\n\ntold him that the 2016 Appeal failed. According to Appellant, Direct Appeal\n\nCounsel told him: “the [2016 Appeal] had been denied. . . . [H]e told me\n\nthat, hey, we tried.      It got shot down.      It didn’t have merit.”   N.T. PCRA\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 Direct Appeal Counsel passed away on July 8, 2020.

Appellant testified that this was the last contact he\n\nhad with Direct Appeal Counsel. Id.\n\n       Appellant testified that, in January or February of 2024, he was in\n\nprison3 and researching caselaw for a separate case when he discovered that\n\nDirect Appeal Counsel had misled him on the reason why the 2016 Appeal\n\nfailed. Id. at 7 and 14-15.\n\n       As Appellant testified, from 2016 until 2024, he did not do anything to\n\nsearch for the 2016 Appeal. Id. at 14. Appellant testified: “I never thought\n\nto. I . . . believed [Direct Appeal Counsel]. He told me [it] didn’t have merit,\n\nso . . . what he told me [was] the reason for not researching it.”          Id.\n\nNevertheless, Appellant testified that, “throughout the time [he was] in\n\nvarious prisons, [there was] always a law library for [him] to use.” Id. at 21.\n\n       On October 9, 2024, the PCRA court dismissed Appellant’s petition as\n\nuntimely, reasoning that Appellant failed to meet his burden of proving “that\n\nthe Superior Court’s dismissal of [the 2016 Appeal] on procedural grounds . .\n\n. could not have been discovered by the exercise of [due] diligence more than\n\na year before the instant petition was filed.” PCRA Court Order, 10/9/24, at\n\n1. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and raises one claim to this Court:\n\n         Whether the [PCRA] court erred in denying Appellant’s PCRA\n         [petition] in finding that Appellant had the duty to second\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 Appellant testified that he has been incarcerated since January 2013, with\n\nonly limited periods of release. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/18/24, at 12. He\ntestified that, during this time, he was only free from May 4, 2017 until\nOctober 13, 2017 and from March 2022 until March 2023. Id. at 12-13.\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S26026-25\n\n\n        guess information provided by appellate counsel in order to\n        have fulfilled the due diligence requirement for the PCRA\n        timeliness exception[?]\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 4.\n\n      “We review a ruling by the PCRA court to determine whether it is\n\nsupported by the record and is free of legal error. Our standard of review of\n\na PCRA court's legal conclusions is de novo.” Commonwealth v. Cousar,\n\n154 A.3d 287, 296 (Pa. 2017) (citations omitted).

As our Supreme Court has\n\nexplained:\n\n        We will not disturb the findings of the PCRA court if they are\n        supported by the record, even where the record could\n        support a contrary holding.

We affirm.\n\fJ-S20004-25\n\n\n\n       The relevant background and procedural history of this case is as\n\nfollows. On January 17, 1980, a jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree\n\nmurder, criminal attempt, unlicensed concealed carry of a firearm, and two\n\ncounts each of aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person\n\n(REAP).1 Thereafter, on January 21, 1980, Appellant received a sentence of\n\nlife imprisonment. This Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence on\n\nMay 11, 1984, see Commonwealth v. Bainbridge, 476 A.2d 68 (Pa. Super.\n\n1984) (non-precedential decision), and our Supreme Court denied Appellant's\n\npetition for allowance of appeal on October 1, 1984.         Appellant did not file a\n\npetition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court; hence,\n\nhis judgment of sentence became final on December 31, 1984, when the time\n\nfor filing such a petition expired.            See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(3); U.S.\n\nSupreme Ct. Rule 13(1) (allowing 90 days to file petition for writ of certiorari).\n\n       Appellant filed his first petition for collateral relief pursuant to the\n\nPost-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) on August 15, 1985. Appellant then filed\n\nPCRA petitions on January 7, 2008, March 13, 2013, and his current petition\n\non May 17, 2024.        As Appellant did not file the instant PCRA petition (his\n\nfourth) until May 17, 2024, it is patently untimely since it was not filed within\n\na year of the date Appellant’s judgment of sentence became final. See 42\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 See 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2502(a), 901, 6106, 2702, and 2705, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S20004-25\n\n\n\nPa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(1).2, 3 Appellant’s claim on appeal is that the PCRA court\n\nerred in dismissing his petition as untimely without the benefit of an\n\nevidentiary hearing.        See Appellant’s Brief at 7-13.     More specifically,\n\nAppellant alleges that, based upon administrative procedures within the\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 The one-year grace period adopted with the 1995 amendments to the PCRA\n\ndo not apply in this case. As we have previously explained:\n\n       Where a judgment of sentence was final more than one year prior\n       to the effective date of the PCRA, a one-year grace period was\n       available as follows: “[A] petition where the judgment of sentence\n       became final before the effective date of the amendments shall be\n       deemed timely if the petitioner's first petition was filed within one\n       year of the effective date of the amendments.” Act of November\n       17, 1995, P.L. 1118, No. 32 (Spec.Sess. No. 1), § 3(1). We\n       recently held that the one-year exception only applies to first\n       PCRA petitions. Commonwealth v. Thomas, 718 A.2d 326 (Pa.\n       Super. 1998)[; see also Commonwealth v. Alcorn, 703 A.2d\n       1054, 1057 (Pa. Super. 1997)]. Thus, a petitioner's first PCRA\n       petition, which would be untimely because it was filed more than\n       one year after the judgment of sentence became final, would be\n       deemed timely [only] if was filed by January 16, 1997.\n\nCommonwealth v. Austin, 721 A.2d 375, 378 (Pa. Super. 1998) (emphasis\nadded).\n\nWhile Appellant's PCRA petition here is governed by Section 9545(b), it does\nnot receive the benefit of the grace period because it is a fourth PCRA petition.\nThus, under Section 9545(b)(1), Appellant had to file his petition within one\nyear from the date his judgment of sentence became final or demonstrate that\nhe qualified for one of the exceptions enumerated in Section 9545(b)(1). As\nwe shall explain above, Appellant has not validly invoked an exception in this\ncase.\n\n3 On May 29, 2024, shortly after Appellant filed his latest petition for collateral\n\nrelief, the PCRA court issued notice of its intent to dismiss the petition\npursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. Appellant filed his response on June 14, 2024,\nand the court dismissed the petition on June 18, 2024. Appellant filed a\ntimely, pro se notice of appeal on July 8, 2024, and both the PCRA court and\nAppellant have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S20004-25\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC) – including inadequate law\n\nlibrary time and periodic confiscation of inmate property, he validly invoked\n\nthe   governmental       interference     exception    to   the   PCRA’s    timeliness\n\nrequirement, which is set forth at 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(1)(i).4                  See\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 21-27.\n\n       The record confirms that no exception applies. Appellant has neither\n\nalleged nor proven that the delay in raising his current claims was caused by\n\nthe interference of government officials as contemplated by Section\n\n9545(b)(1)(i). In particular, Appellant fails to plead and prove that DOC’s\n\nadministrative policies or the actions of its personnel relevant to this case\n\nviolated the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or\n\nlaws of the United States.           Thus, Section 9545(b)(1)(i) is inapplicable.\n\nMoreover, Appellant has not developed claims alleging application of either\n\nthe unknown facts exception found at Section 9545(b)(1)(ii) or the\n\nnewly-recognized       constitutional     rights   exception   included    at   Section\n\n9545(b)(1)(iii).

We affirm.\n\n       On June 21, 2024, Appellant received a traffic citation for driving while\n\noperating privilege suspended and operating a vehicle without a valid\n\ninspection.1    A summary trial was scheduled for August 6, 2024 before\n\nMagisterial District Judge (“MDJ”) Steven Chieffo. Appellant failed to appear\n\nand, as such, was found guilty of the aforementioned summary offenses in\n\nabsentia.\n\n       On September 25, 2024, Appellant, through counsel, filed a petition for\n\nnunc pro tunc appeal of his summary convictions. In his petition, Appellant\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 75 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1543(a) and 4703(a), respectively.\n\fJ-S26022-25\n\n\n\nalleged that he was entitled to nunc pro tunc review because he “was not\n\nrepresented by counsel and[, therefore,] was unaware [that an] appeal was\n\nto be filed within [30] days” of his conviction. Appellant’s Petition, 9/25/24,\n\nat *1 (unpaginated). Thereafter, the trial court entered an order scheduling\n\na hearing on Appellant’s petition for December 5, 2024 and directed the\n\nparties to submit memoranda on or before November 27, 2024.\n\n      On November 26, 2024, Appellant submitted a memorandum of law in\n\nsupport of his request for nunc pro tunc relief. In his memorandum, Appellant\n\nstated:\n\n          On June 21[, 2024, Appellant] was pulled over by law\n          enforcement in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Shortly thereafter,\n          he received notices in the mail warning of a possible warrant for\n          his arrest if the matter was not addressed promptly. Seeking\n          to resolve the issue, [Appellant] traveled to the Berks County\n          Magisterial Court on Jule 23[, 2024,] to address the warrant\n          and secure a court date. … A court appearance was initially\n          scheduled for August 6[, 2024]. On that date, [Appellant]\n          arrived at the courthouse . . . where he spoke with the court\n          clerk.   The clerk advised him that his appearance [was]\n          rescheduled [for] August 19[, 2024,] and instructed him to\n          return on that date instead. Following the clerk’s guidance,\n          [Appellant] left the courthouse.\n\n          On August 19, [2024, Appellant] appeared in court as directed.\n          [MDJ Chieffo] expressed frustration that [Appellant] had not\n          appeared on August 6[, 2024,] the originally scheduled date.\n          When questioned, the clerk denied having instructed\n          [Appellant] to return on August [19, 2024].\n\nAppellant’s Memorandum of Law, 11/26/25, at *1-*2 (unpaginated).\n\nAppellant then claimed that the foregoing “created a significant breakdown in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fJ-S26022-25\n\n\n\ncourt operations” and, on this basis, asked the trial court to grant his petition\n\nfor nunc pro tunc relief. Id. at *3.\n\n       The parties appeared for the scheduled hearing on December 5, 2024.2\n\nAppellant did not testify at the hearing, nor did Appellant produce any\n\nwitnesses. See Trial Court Opinion, 3/17/25, at 2. The trial court denied\n\nAppellant’s petition at the conclusion of the hearing.        This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.3\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 A transcript of the December 5, 2024 hearing is not included in the certified\n\nrecord. “It is black letter law in this jurisdiction that an appellate court cannot\nconsider anything which is not part of the record in [the] case.” Eichman v.\nMcKeon, 824 A.2d 305, 316 (Pa. Super. 2003) (citation omitted). Indeed, it\nis equally settled that it “is the responsibility of the appellant to provide a\ncomplete record to the appellate court on appeal” and that any “document\nwhich is not part of the official certified record is considered to be\nnon-existent.” Id. (citation omitted). Due to Appellant’s failure to include the\nDecember 5, 2024 transcript, we are bound by the trial court’s explanation\nthereof.\n\n3 Our review of the certified record reveals that Appellant retained counsel to\n\nfile his petition for nunc pro tunc appeal of his summary conviction and that\nhe was represented by counsel during the December 5, 2024 hearing. It does\nnot appear, however, that counsel ever formally entered his appearance in\nthis matter. In this same vein, it does not appear that counsel ever formally\nwithdrew his appearance in this matter. This is significant given the fact that\nAppellant proceeded in the instant appeal pro se. Indeed, Appellant filed his\nnotice of appeal pro se on January 3, 2025. Thereafter, on January 7, 2025,\nthe trial court issued an order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) directing\nAppellant to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal within\n21 days, i.e., on or before January 28, 2025. Appellant, acting pro se, did\nnot file his Rule 1925(b) statement until January 31, 2025. In general, the\n“failure to comply with the minimal requirements of Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) will\nresult in automatic waiver of the issues raised.” Greater Erie Indus. Dev.\nCorp. v. Presque Isle Downs, Inc., 88 A.3d 222, 224 (Pa. Super. 2014) (en\nbanc) (citation omitted). There are no entries on the trial court’s docket,\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S26022-25\n\n\n\n       Appellant raises the following issues for our consideration.\n\n        1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying nunc pro\n           tunc relief despite extraordinary circumstances caused by\n           counsel’s delay?\n\n        2. Did the trial court violate Appellant’s due process rights by\n           failing to provide effective notice of the rescheduled hearing?\n\n        3. Did the trial court improperly penalize Appellant based on\n           inaccurate information provided by the county clerk?\n\n        4. Was Appellant’s license suspension unjust given full payment\n           and resolution of the underlying citation?\n\n        5. Did the court’s delay in mailing critical orders prejudice\n           Appellant’s right to timely appeal?\n\nAppellant’s Brief at *2-*3 (unpaginated) (emphasis added).\n\n       In Appellant’s first three issues, he challenges the trial court’s order\n\ndenying his petition to appeal his summary convictions nunc pro tunc.\n\nAppellant claims that, in so doing, the trial court committed an error of law\n\nbecause his “delay in appealing was caused by . . . court miscommunications,\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nhowever, which confirm the fact and manner of service of its order upon\nAppellant in his pro se status. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 114(C)(2)(c) (docket entries\nshall contain the date of service of a court order).            In view of the\ncircumstances, we will treat this appeal as timely filed. See Commonwealth\nv. Midgley, 289 A.3d 1111, 1117 (Pa. Super. 2023) (“Where the trial court\ndocket in a criminal case does not indicate service on a party or the date of\nservice, we will not quash the appeal or require further proceedings.

Cooke also challenges the characterization the area\n\nwhere the transaction occurred as “high-crime.” Upon review, we affirm the\n\ntrial court’s conclusions that the officer did not give false testimony and the\n\nalleged “high-crime” character of the location of the transaction is irrelevant.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 See 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 6105, 6106, 6108.\n\fJ-A12034-25\n\n\n       The Commonwealth presented the following testimony at the hearing on\n\nCooke’s motion to suppress.2 On November 4, 2020, at approximately 6:00\n\np.m., Officer Stephanie Fazio (“Officer Fazio”) and her partner, Officer\n\nMcConnell,3 were conducting a narcotics surveillance of a corner store (“the\n\nGuchy store”), at 5015 North Broad Street, a locus of violent crime in a high-\n\ncrime area. See N.T., 11/13/23, at 7-8, 11, 35. Officer Fazio had been a\n\nmember of the Philadelphia Police Narcotics Enforcement team for nearly five\n\nyears, participated in approximately 600 surveillances leading to 400 arrests,\n\nand had been the lead investigator on 200 of those cases, 30-40 in the\n\nsurveillance area. See id. at 10. Officer Fazio saw a man in a green jacket\n\nand black pants standing outside the Guchy store with a group of other men;\n\nthe group then went inside the store. See id. at 15.\n\n       At 6:10 p.m., Cooke, who wore a pink hat, a tan hoodie, and blue jeans,\n\nentered the store and approached the man with the green jacket and black\n\npants. See id. at 15, 18. Cooke gave the man U.S. currency in exchange for\n\nan unknown, small object. See id. at 16, 21. Cooke left the store; Officer\n\nFazio radioed his description to a backup unit. Officer Miller 4 told Officer Fazio\n\nhe and his partner, later identified as Officer Shawn Bossert (“Officer\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 Cooke originally pled guilty, withdrew his guilty plea, then filed a suppression\n\nmotion on which the trial court held a hearing.\n\n3 The certified record does not contain Officer McConnell’s first name.\n\n\n4 The certified record does not contain Officer Miller’s first name.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-A12034-25\n\n\nBossert”), were pursuing a man matching Cooke’s description. Officer Fazio\n\nsaw Officer Miller chasing Cooke (who had run in a “U”-shaped pattern).\n\nOfficer Fazio and Officer McConnell left the surveillance site during the pursuit\n\nof Cooke. See id. at 28. Officer Miller and other officers detained Cooke at a\n\nnearby gas station parking lot. See id. at 16-19. Officer Fazio testified that\n\nbecause the officers found a gun when they detained Cooke, a number of\n\nofficers responded to that location, which left the police without an available\n\nofficer to detain the man to whom Cooke gave U.S. currency. See id. at 22.\n\n       During    his   cross-examination       of   Officer   Fazio,   Cooke’s   counsel\n\n(“Counsel”) played a video recording from Officer McConnell’s body-worn\n\ncamera, Exhibit C-7.5 The video apparently shows officers detaining a man in\n\na green jacket at the Guchy store and searching him at Officer McConnell’s\n\ndirection. Counsel asked Officer Fazio how this video evidence related to her\n\ntestimony that the police had not arrested or charged a man in a green jacket,\n\nand suggested Officer Fazio gave contradictory testimony or withheld the\n\n“fact” the alleged seller was searched and had no drugs. 6              See id. at 27.\n\nOfficer Fazio responded that the Commonwealth’s question on direct\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5 Cooke has failed to ensure the presence of the video in the certified record,\n\nso we utilize the suppression hearing testimony.\n\n6 Officer Fazio testified upon hearing the audio from Officer McConnell’s body-\n\nworn camera that it recorded Officer McConnell directing the search of certain\nmen in the store. See id. at 27. She testified she believed the seller had left\nthe area before the search occurred. See id. There was no evidence showing\nwhere Officer Fazio was when Officer McConnell directed the search.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A12034-25\n\n\nexamination had been whether the seller had been arrested, to which she\n\nanswered that she could not confirm that the seller had been arrested. See\n\nid. at 23, 27-28.7 Officer Fazio testified her paperwork indicated the seller\n\nhad “walked off when all that commotion was going on,” and further that she\n\nand her partner had left the surveillance site at about the time Cooke fled.\n\nSee id. at 27, 28.8 Apparently commenting about what she saw on Officer\n\nMcConnell’s body-worn camera video, Officer Fazio testified Officer McConnell\n\nsaid to officers conducting a search, “They’re all good” (meaning they had no\n\ndrugs) about the people who had been searched. Officer Fazio restated her\n\nbelief the seller had walked off prior to that search. See id. at 29.9\n\n       Officer Bossert testified that at 6:10 p.m., he and Officer Miller were on\n\nbackup for plainclothes narcotics surveillance about two blocks from the gas\n\nstation where Officer Miller later stopped Cooke. See id. at 33-35. Officers\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\n7 Officer Fazio testified that from her vantage point she could not see anything\n\nthat happened in the back of the store. See id. at 23, 27-28.\n\n8 Officer Fazio testified, “[O]nce Officer Miller was in pursuit [of Cooke], we\n\ninitially . . . drove across Broad Street, and [Cooke] was stopped, and then\nwe leave the location. That’s why I’m saying you never hear anyone say that\nyes, that was the seller. We usually positively ID someone before they’re\nbrought in. . . . There’s no conversation about anyone being positively ID’ed\nas the seller, and I can’t testify as to why this officer stopped the male.” Id.\nat 28.\n\n9\n Cooke’s Brief asserts Officer Fazio was sitting in the surveillance vehicle with\nOfficer McConnell as he directed the search. See Cooke’s Brief at 21, n.4.\nThere is no record evidence supporting that assertion.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-A12034-25\n\n\nBossert and Miller received Officer Fazio’s “flash” description of Cooke’s\n\ndistinctive clothing and saw Cooke within one minute. See id. at 36-37, 41.\n\nOfficer Bossert testified that as they drove in Cooke’s direction in their marked\n\npatrol car, Cooke looked their way and fled. See id. at 37. Officer Miller got\n\nout of the patrol car and chased Cooke; Officer Bossert briefly lost sight of the\n\npursuit. See id. at 38. Officer Bossert testified that following a chase, Officer\n\nMiller detained Cooke and recovered a loaded Glock .22 from his waistband.\n\nSee id. at 39-40.\n"}

Appellant was sentenced in accordance\n          with his Guilty Plea Colloquy completed on October 10,\n          2024, including a mandatory minimum period of\n          incarceration of ninety (90) days to five (5) years based on\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3802(c).\n\fJ-S28038-25\n\n\n          prior acceptance of accelerated rehabilitation disposition\n          [(“ARD”)] for a prior DUI offense.[2] Additionally, Appellant\n          was sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution, a fine of\n          $1500.00, an Act 198 fee of $300.00, and Restitution in the\n          amount of $11,410.08…. Also, Appellant was made pre-\n          release center eligible.      The [c]ourt further granted\n          Appellant’s Motion to Stay the Sentence pending the filing\n          of appeal within the next thirty (30) days. Appellant\n          [timely] appealed from the November 19, 2024, Sentencing\n          Order by filing his Notice of Appeal and Concise Statement\n          of Matters Complained of on Appeal with the [c]ourt on\n          December 6, 2024, by and through counsel[.] …\n\n(Trial Court Opinion, filed 3/21/25, at 1).\n\n       Appellant raises the following issues for our review:\n\n          In light of Alleyne v. United States, [570 U.S. 99, 133\n          S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314] (2013) was it not\n          unconstitutional for the Trial Court to consider Appellant-\n          Defendant’s past acceptance of ARD as a prior offense for\n          sentencing purposes since ARD does not provide a citizen\n          with the procedural protections afforded by Alleyne, i.e., a\n          prior offense can only be determined by proof beyond a\n          reasonable doubt?\n\n          Is it not fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process\n          to equate a prior acceptance of ARD with a prior conviction\n          for purposes of a recidivist mandatory minimum sentence\n          even though that acceptance involved no proof of guilt\n          beyond a reasonable doubt?\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 8).\n\n       As a preliminary matter, we note that during the pendency of this\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 See 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3804(c)(2) (providing mandatory minimum of not less\n\nthan 90 days’ imprisonment for defendant convicted of Section 3802(c)\n(highest rate of alcohol) where current offense is second DUI offense); 75\nPa.C.S.A. § 3806 (including acceptance of ARD as “prior offense” for purposes\nof DUI sentencing statute). See also 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3803 (grading of DUI\noffenses).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S28038-25\n\n\nappeal, our Supreme Court decided Commonwealth v. Shifflett, ___ Pa.\n\n___, 335 A.3d 1158 (2025).      In Shifflett, our Supreme Court held that a\n\ndefendant’s prior acceptance of ARD is a fact that must be submitted to a jury\n\npursuant to the United States Supreme Court’s decisions in Alleyne, supra\n\nand Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d\n\n435 (2000):\n\n         In sum, because acceptance into an ARD program does not\n         offer a defendant any of the constitutional safeguards that\n         accompany either a criminal conviction or a guilty plea\n         proceeding, safeguards on which the Supreme Court’s\n         recognition of a prior conviction exception in Apprendi and\n         Alleyne was based, we conclude that a defendant’s\n         previous acceptance of ARD, on its own, does not fall within\n         the prior conviction exception contemplated in Apprendi\n         and Alleyne. Thus, an individual’s previous acceptance of\n         ARD, which, when construed as a prior offense under\n         Section 3806 to increase the penalty for a subsequent\n         conviction pursuant to Section 3804, is a fact that must be\n         submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nShifflett, supra at ___, 335 A.3d at 1175.\n\n      Based upon the express holding in Shifflett, the trial court erred in\n\nsentencing Appellant as a second-time offender for the current DUI offense\n\nbased on Appellant’s prior acceptance of ARD.       Our Supreme Court has\n\nexpressly determined that an individual’s previous acceptance of ARD is a fact\n\nthat must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt for enhanced statutory\n\npenalties to apply. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for resentencing.\n\n      Judgment of sentence vacated.       Case remanded for resentencing.\n\nJurisdiction is relinquished.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-S28038-25\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin D.

We affirm.\n\n      The PCRA court accurately recounted the evidence against Appellant as\n\nfollows:\n\n      [A]t at approximately three o'clock in the afternoon of October 21,\n      2013, [Appellant] and another male snuck around the corner of\n      Ditman and Granite Streets in Philadelphia and began firing at a\n      group of males congregated around the steps of 5121 Ditman\n      Street, resulting in the murder of Khaalid Boyd.             Andre\n      Richardson, Domonte Dark, and Kelsey Dark, friends of the\n      deceased, witnessed the shooting. Each gave statements to the\n      police following the shooting, which identified [Appellant], “Quiz”\n      as the gunman.\n\n      Andre Richardson testified that on October 21, 2013, at\n      approximately 3:00 in the afternoon, he was outside of 5123\n      Ditman Street with several friends, including Khaalid Boyd and\n\fJ-S12002-25\n\n\n     Kelsey Dark, when [Appellant], wearing a red hoodie, and an\n     unknown male ran up and started shooting at them. (N.T. 2-10-\n     15, pp. 55-63). Richardson testified that he ran when the shots\n     were fired but returned later to see if Khaalid Boyd was alright.\n     Richardson did not tell the officers at the scene what he had\n     observed as it was his intention to exact retribution for the\n     shooting himself. (N.T. 2-10-15, pp. 65-68).\n\n     Domonte Dark’s testimony established that he heard gunshots\n     and that Quiz “had on a red hoody and he was shooting at us.”\n     (N.T. 2-10-15, pp. 130-131, 142). Dark further stated that “after\n     they finished shooting, they got back into the Honda Accord. Quiz\n     pointed at me and skid off, then he hit a black Ford. I think he\n     was coming after me.” (N.T. 2-10-15, p. 144). Domonte believed\n     that “it was over some he say/she say stuff over the block. The\n     problem was between me and him. Someone told him that I was\n     out to kill him.” (N.T. 2-10-15, p. 143).\n\n     Kelsey Dark testified that he was outside of 5121 Ditman Street\n     on October 21, 2013, when he heard shots and ran. (N.T. 2-10-\n     15, p. 166). At the time he was living next door at 5123 Ditman\n     Street. (N.T. 2-10-15, p. 168). Kelsey Dark was interviewed by\n     the police regarding this incident on October 31, 2013, at which\n     time he stated that his brother, Domonte Dark, “got shot in the\n     leg a couple days ago,” in response to whether there were any\n     recent threats made towards him or his brother. (N.T. 2-10-15,\n     p. 177). Detective Charles Grebloski, who took the interview of\n     Kelsey Dark, also testified at trial regarding Kelsey Dark’s\n     statements. (N.T. 2-11-15, pp. 46-60).\n\n     Kelly Myhausuk, a school psychologist who works at Hardy Middle\n     School, located on Torresdale Avenue, near the 5100 block of\n     Ditman Street, testified as well. (N.T. 2-11-15, pp. 4-5). Ms.\n     Myhausuk testified that on October 21, 2013, she left the school\n     around 3:30 p.m. driving her car at the intersection of Ditman and\n     Granite Streets. (N.T. 2-11-15, pp. 5-6). While at the junction,\n     she saw “two young African American males coming down Granite,\n     hugging the side of the building. I observed them peeking around\n     the corner looking up and down Ditman, which I kind of thought\n     was suspicious.” (N.T. 2-11-15, p. 7). “The male closest to me\n     was in a red hoody.” (N.T. 2-11-15, pp. 8-9). She observed the\n     man in the red hoodie take out a gun, and then both men proceed\n     into the middle of Ditman Street. (N.T. 2-11-15, pp. 8-12). Ms.\n     Myhausuk testified that she had seen a crowd of people\n\n                                   -2-\n\fJ-S12002-25\n\n\n       congregated outside of the third or fourth house from the corner.\n       (N.T. 2-I1-15, p. 12).\n\n       When Ms. Myhausuk looked up after the shooting had stopped,\n       she started to proceed through the intersection, but was “hit by a\n       car traveling on Granite,” which pushed her car “up onto the\n       sidewalk and [the] air bags deployed.” (N.T. 2-11-15, p. 9). She\n       described the car that hit her as a gold, older model sedan, and\n       the passengers in that car to be the same men that had just fired\n       the shots. (N.T. 2-11-15, p. 15). She stated, \" I believe the male\n       in the red hoody was driving the car and the male with the white\n       tee shirt was a passenger.\" (N.T. 2-11-15, p. 15).\n\n       There was further evidence provided at trial that a gold Honda was\n       left at the scene, which was processed for evidence, and a video\n       was recovered from a corner store that showed people fleeing the\n       area. (N.T. 2-11-15, pp. 123-125).\n\nPCRA Court Opinion, 6/18/24, at 4-6.1\n\n       On November 17, 2013, Appellant was charged with murder, attempted\n\nmurder, conspiracy, firearms not to be carried without a license, recklessly\n\nendangering another         person, aggravated assault, and possessing an\n\ninstrument of crime. On February 13, 2015, following a jury trial, Appellant\n\nwas convicted on all charges.         Subsequently, the court imposed sentence.\n\nAppellant timely appealed to this Court, which affirmed his judgment of\n\nsentence, and our Supreme Court denied his petition for allowance of appeal.\n\n       The PCRA court described the PCRA proceedings as follows:\n\n       [Appellant] filed his PCRA petition on July 14, 2017. Counsel was\n       appointed who filed a Finley2 letter. A notice of intent to dismiss\n       was sent to all parties on January 31, 2020, following which on\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 The PCRA court’s opinion is appended to this memorandum.\n\n\n2 Commonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa. Super. 1988).\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S12002-25\n\n\n     March 2, 2020, the petition was dismissed. [Appellant] timely\n     appealed. On May 26, 2020, an order pursuant to Pennsylvania\n     Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(b) was sent to [Appellant]\n     requiring [him] to provide a statement of matters complained of\n     on appeal within twenty-one days. Appellant failed to respond\n     and after waiting nearly three months for the 1925(b) statement,\n     this court filed an opinion recommending the dismissal of\n     [Appellant]’s appeal.\n\n     On December 16, 2020, an Order was entered by the Superior\n     Court remanding the matter for a determination of whether\n     counsel had abandoned [Appellant]. This court responded that\n     counsel had not abandoned [Appellant] on February 9, 2021, and\n     entered an order allowing counsel to withdraw. [Appellant] then\n     filed a subsequent pro se PCRA on February 23, 2021, with a\n     request for extension of time on March 3rd of that year.

The matter proceeded\n\nto a jury trial that commenced on December 6, 2021.\n\n       At trial, Pennsylvania State Trooper, Kristopher Williams, testified that\n\non December 21, 2019, he and several other state troopers responded to a\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\n\n1 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9541-9546.\n\fJ-A05028-25\n\n\n\nSuper 8 Hotel due to a report that two males with firearms were outside room\n\n309. When he arrived on location, Trooper Williams knocked on the door to\n\nroom 309 and Appellant opened the door.      While conducting a protective\n\nsweep of the hotel room, the troopers saw a glass smoking device in plain\n\nsight on the nightstand between the two beds.     No other individuals were\n\nfound in the room. Appellant was arrested and searched. From Appellant’s\n\nperson, Trooper Williams recovered a plastic bag containing a substance that\n\nwas suspected to be crystal methamphetamine.\n\n      Trooper Williams took Appellant to the station and interviewed him.\n\nAppellant told Trooper Williams that there were four bricks of heroin, a\n\nfirearm, and cash inside the hotel room. Appellant reported that these items\n\nbelonged to an individual named Matthew Meholic.      Corporal Justin Duval\n\nconducted a search of Appellant’s person while he was at the station and\n\nrecovered packets of suspected heroin and $1,335.00 in cash from inside\n\nAppellant’s underwear. After obtaining a search warrant, Trooper Williams\n\nsearched room 309 and recovered 180 white stamp bags labeled “Power”\n\ncontaining a substance suspected to be heroin, a bag containing a substance\n\nsuspected to be crystal methamphetamine, a firearm, and $450.00 in cash.\n\nTrooper Williams further collected various items of drug paraphernalia from\n\nthe hotel room.    Trooper Williams testified as follows in relation to the\n\ncollection of these items:\n\n         [Prosecutor:]       So starting with Exhibit 4, what are we\n         looking at there?\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fJ-A05028-25\n\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] Okay. So what you are looking at [are]\n         empty stamped bags labeled as Power. There were 31 of\n         them. A yellow and black snorting straw and then a green\n         and black lighter.\n\n         [Prosecutor:]        Okay. So what was the significance of\n         you collecting those three items, classes of items?\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] The empty stamped bags labeled as\n         Power, they were not filled yet with any heroin but they are\n         indicative to people selling narcotics.\n\n         [Prosecutor:]        And the other two items?\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] The yellow and black snorting straw,\n         that is just for drug use[,] and then the green and black\n         lighter. It was a green and black butane lighter which is\n         indicative to usually for using the glass smoking device that\n         was first found in plain view which is used at the time to\n         usually smoke meth.\n\n(N.T. Trial, 12/6/21, at 32). When asked if he could explain what stamp bags\n\nare, Trooper Williams testified that they are glassine bags that are stamped\n\nwith some type of insignia by a drug dealer so that customers can recognize\n\nthe product. In describing the stamp bags recovered from the hotel, Trooper\n\nWilliams testified that stamp bags of that size usually contain heroin.\n\n      Trooper Williams further testified that he sent the suspected narcotics\n\nto the Pennsylvania Regional Laboratory for testing.      The Commonwealth\n\nmoved to admit the lab report into evidence and the court admitted the lab\n\nreport without objection from Appellant.      Trooper Williams identified the\n\nsubstances tested as the items that were recovered from Appellant’s person\n\nand the hotel room. Trooper Williams further read the results of the testing\n\nfor each substance, confirming that they were heroin and methamphetamine.\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-A05028-25\n\n\n\n     During Trooper Williams’ testimony, the Commonwealth introduced\n\nexhibits of the physical evidence gathered from Appellant’s person and the\n\nhotel room. As Trooper Williams was handling these exhibits, the prosecutor\n\nexpressed concern about opening the sealed packets of evidence due to fear\n\nthat they might contain Fentanyl. Specifically, the following exchanges took\n\nplace:\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] Do you want me to open this one\n         because it has heroin in it.\n\n         [Prosecutor:]        Is that the one. Yes.\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] There’s heroin in here as well.\n\n         [Prosecutor:]         Okay.        I’m   just   worrying   about\n         Fentanyl, that’s all?\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] It’s sealed.\n\n                                 *      *     *\n\n         [Prosecutor:]        And does it remain sealed as we stand\n         here today?\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] Yes, ma’am.\n\n         [Prosecutor:]        Is there a concern of Fentanyl being on\n         the stamp bags at all?\n\n         [Trooper Williams:] None of these do. The stamp bags that\n         were in here were found empty.\n\n(N.T. Trial, 12/6/21, at 26, 32-33).        These sealed evidence packets were\n\nsubsequently opened and published to the jury. When they were shown to\n\nthe jury, Trooper Williams identified the substances in the packets as heroin\n\nand methamphetamine.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fJ-A05028-25\n\n\n      Corporal Eric Friend was accepted as an expert in the field of narcotics\n\ninvestigation. Corporal Friend testified in detail about the use of stamp bags\n\nin the sale of drugs. Specifically, Corporal Friend explained that stamp bags\n\nare commonly used in the drug trade to package drugs for sale and are\n\ntypically stamped with some sort of identifying marker. He further opined\n\nthat the stamp bags recovered from Appellant’s person and the hotel room\n\nwere consistent with those that are typically used for the sale of heroin.\n\nCorporal Friend further explained why a drug dealer or user might have empty\n\nor used stamp bags in their possession. Based on the amount of narcotics\n\nand cash recovered from Appellant’s person and the hotel room, the location\n\nof the hotel, and the presence of a firearm, Corporal Friend opined that\n\nAppellant possessed the narcotics for the purpose of distribution.\n\n      Appellant testified that an individual named Matthew Meholic rented the\n\nhotel room. Appellant was inside the hotel room using methamphetamines\n\nand heroin when he saw two men brandishing firearms outside the room.\n\nAppellant testified that he c"}

On June 3,\n____________________________________________\n\n\n* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\n\n1 75 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1543, 1786, 3714, 3304, and 4581, respectively.\n\fJ-S27035-25\n\n\n              2024, [Appellant] filed a Petition For Leave to Appeal\n              these Summary Convictions, Nunc Pro Tunc. A\n              hearing was then scheduled to occur on July 8, 2024,\n              before this Trial Court regarding [Appellant’s] Petition\n              for Leave to Appeal the Summary Convictions, Nunc\n              Pro Tunc. However, July 8, 2024, [Appellant] failed\n              to appear for this hearing and this Trial Court\n              therefore entered an Order denying her petition due\n              to her failure to appear.\n\n              On July 18, 2024, [Appellant] filed a Notice of Appeal\n              from this Trial[] Court’s July 8, 2024 Order to the\n              Superior Court. On September 26, 2024, [Appellant]\n              filed a “Statement in Support of my Appeal,” [which\n              the court treated as a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement.].\n              In this Statement, [Appellant] contends that she was\n              unable to attend the July 8, 2024[] hearing due to\n              issues surrounding her pregnancy, childcare, divorce,\n              housing, transportation, and lack of counsel.\n\nTrial court opinion, 11/14/24 at 1-2 (footnoted omitted). 2\n\n       Appellant raises the following issues for our review:\n\n              1.     Whether the [trial court] erred by failing to\n                     provide notice and opportunity to show cause\n                     for failure to appear at the hearing on July 8,\n                     2024?\n\n              2.     Whether the [trial court] erred by denying\n                     Appellant’s Petition for Leave to Appeal Nunc\n                     Pro Tunc despite demonstrating excusable\n                     neglect due to divorce, pregnancy, housing\n                     instability, childcare obligations, and lack of\n                     transportation?\n\nAppellant’s brief at 2 (extraneous capitalization omitted).\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 The trial court filed its Rule 1925(a) opinion on November 14, 2024.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S27035-25\n\n\n      Our standard of review of an order denying a petition to appeal nunc\n\npro tunc is as follows:\n\n            [A]llowance of appeal nunc pro tunc is within the\n            sound discretion of the trial court, and our scope of\n            review of a decision of whether to permit an appeal\n            nunc pro tunc is limited to a determination of\n            whether the trial court has abused its discretion or\n            committed an error of law.        Orders granting or\n            denying [a] petition to appeal nunc pro tunc are\n            reversible [only] in instances where the court abused\n            its discretion or where the court drew an erroneous\n            legal conclusion.\n\nCommonwealth v. Yohe, 641 A.2d 1210, 1211 (Pa.Super. 1994) (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted; some brackets in original).\n\n      Here, Appellant did not file a timely appeal within 30 days of her\n\nsummary convictions. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 460(A) (stating, inter alia, that “an\n\nappeal shall be perfected by filing a notice of appeal within 30 days after the\n\nentry of the guilty plea, the conviction, or other final order from which the\n\nappeal is taken.”).     Therefore, the only way Appellant could attack the\n\nconvictions was by obtaining relief through a petition for leave to appeal nunc\n\npro tunc. “[A]n appeal nunc pro tunc is intended as a remedy to vindicate\n\nthe right to an appeal where that right has been lost due to certain\n\nextraordinary circumstances.” Commonwealth v. Williams, 893 A.2d 147,\n\n150 (Pa.Super. 2006) (citation omitted), appeal denied, 921 A.2d 497 (Pa.\n\n2007).\n\n      It is well settled that,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S27035-25\n\n\n            A party seeking leave to appeal from a summary\n            conviction nunc pro tunc has the burden of\n            demonstrating two things: (1) that the delay in filing\n            his appeal was caused by extraordinary circumstances\n            involving fraud or a wrongful or negligent act of a\n            court official resulting in injury to that party and (2)\n            that upon learning of the existence of the grounds\n            relied upon for nunc pro tunc relief, he acted\n            promptly to seek such relief.\n\nYohe, 641 A.2d at 1212 (citation omitted).\n\n      Based on our review of the record, we discern no abuse of discretion on\n\nthe part of the trial court in denying Appellant’s petition for leave to appeal\n\nnunc pro tunc.       In the instant matter, the trial court never had the\n\nopportunity to address whether Appellant satisfied the above requirements\n\nbecause Appellant failed to even appear at the July 8, 2024 nunc pro tunc\n\nhearing – despite being instructed in writing of the consequences of her failure\n\nto do so – and consequently failed to explain her basis for nunc pro tunc\n\nrelief. See “Notice of Nunc Pro Tunc,” 6/4/24 at ¶ 2.

Melhorn, to driving under the\n\ninfluence (“DUI”) – high rate of alcohol.1 We affirm.\n\n       This Court previously set forth the facts and procedural history of this\n\ncase as follows.\n\n        On July 25, 2021, Appellee was arrested following a traffic stop,\n        and she was subsequently charged with various DUI and\n        summary motor vehicle offenses, as well as violations of the\n        Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. The DUI\n        offenses were charged as second offenses based upon\n        Appellee's resolution of a prior DUI charge through the\n        accelerated rehabilitative disposition (“ARD”) process. Appellee\n        filed an omnibus pre-trial motion seeking to bar consideration\n        of [her] earlier ARD as a prior offense at sentencing.\n\n                                           ***\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3802(b).\n\fJ-S28021-25\n\n\n       At a February 15, 2022 hearing, the trial court granted\n       Appellee's motion to bar consideration of the prior ARD as a first\n       offense for sentencing purposes. Appellee then entered a\n       negotiated guilty plea to one count of DUI—high rate of alcohol\n       as a first offense, ungraded misdemeanor on that date. On April\n       21, 2022, the trial court sentenced Appellee pursuant to the\n       negotiated agreement to serve six months’ probation, including\n       seven days of house arrest, and pay a fine of $500[.00 The\n       Commonwealth appealed].\n\nCommonwealth v. Melhorn, 2023 WL 3303444, *1 (Pa. Super. 2023)\n\n(non-precedential decision) (internal citations omitted), order vacated, 2025\n\nWL 1739503 (Pa. June 24, 2025).\n\n      On appeal, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court erred in\n\nsentencing Appellee as a first-time DUI offender.       Ultimately, this Court\n\nagreed. See id. Appellee, therefore, filed a petition for allowance of appeal,\n\nseeking review in our Supreme Court. On June 24, 2025, our Supreme Court\n\nvacated our prior disposition in this matter and remanded this case back to us\n\nfor reconsideration in light of Commonwealth v. Shifflett, 335 A.3d 1158\n\n(Pa. 2025). In Shifflett, the Supreme Court held “that 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3806(a)\n\n[was] facially unconstitutional to the extent it allows a previous acceptance of\n\n[ARD] to be used as the basis for an enhanced sentence under [75 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n§ 3804.]”   Shifflett, 335 A.3d at 1178. We therefore conclude that, contrary\n\nto the Commonwealth’s claim, the trial court did not err in sentencing Appellee\n\nas a first-time DUI offender.

The complaint charged Appellant with\n\none count each of possession of a controlled substance, PWID, corrupt\n\norganizations, persons not to possess firearms, and criminal use of a\n\ncommunication facility; and two counts of criminal conspiracy. On September\n\n25, 2023, the Commonwealth filed an amended criminal information, which\n\ncharged Appellant as follows:\n\n      Counts 1-44 – manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to\n      manufacture or deliver controlled substances;\n\n      Count 45 – conspiracy to manufacture, deliver, or possession with\n      intent to manufacture or deliver controlled substances;\n\n      Count 46 – corrupt organizations;\n\n      Counts 47 – conspiracy to commit corrupt organizations;\n\n      Counts 48-50 – persons not to possess firearms; and\n\n      Counts 51-187 – criminal use of a communications facility.\n\nSee Trial Court Opinion, 9/27/24, at 3.\n\n      On October 2, 2023, Appellant’s scheduled trial date, Appellant entered\n\nan open guilty plea to all charges listed on the amended information, except\n\nCount 50 (persons not to possess firearms). On January 26, 2024, following\n\nthe preparation of a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) and a hearing,\n\nthe trial court sentenced Appellant as follows:\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S30024-25\n\n\n     COUNTS 1-44: 7-14 years in prison (all concurrent to one\n     another);\n\n     COUNT 45: 5-10 years in prison (concurrent with Counts 1-44);\n\n     COUNT 46: 3.5-7 years in prison (concurrent with Count 45);\n\n     COUNT 47: 2-4 years in prison (concurrent with Count 46);\n\n     COUNT 48: 7-14 years (consecutive to Counts 1-44);\n\n     COUNT 49: 7-14 years in prison (consecutive to Count 48); and\n\n     Counts 51-187: 1-2 years in prison (concurrent with Counts 48-\n     49).\n\nSee id. at 4. Thus, the trial court imposed an aggregate prison term of 21-\n\n42 years.\n\n     Appellant timely filed a motion to reconsider sentence. The trial court\n\nconducted a hearing on the motion on May 13, 2024. On May 15, 2024, the\n\ntrial court denied Appellant’s motion for reconsideration.   Appellant timely\n\nappealed. Appellant and the trial court have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n     On appeal, Appellant presents the following issues for our review:\n\n     [1.] Whether an aggregate sentence of 21 to 42 years[,] within\n     the sentencing guidelines for [Appellant,] is a manifestly\n     unreasonable decision by the trial court because the sentence is\n     excessive given [Appellant’s] history and effectively [constituted]\n     a de facto life sentence for a 44-year-old man in a non-capital\n     case?\n\n     [2.] Whether an aggregate sentence of 21 to 42 years[,] within\n     the sentencing guidelines, [which is] effectively a de facto life\n     sentence for a 44-year-old man in a non-capital case, violates the\n     Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\n     Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, forbidding cruel and\n     unusual punishment?\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-S30024-25\n\n\nAppellant’s Brief at 4.\n\n       Appellant’s first issue challenges the discretionary aspects of his\n\nsentence, from which there is no automatic right to appeal. See 42 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n§ 9781(b).2 Rather, an appellant challenging the sentencing court’s discretion\n\nmust invoke this Court’s jurisdiction by\n\n       (1) filing a timely notice of appeal; (2) properly preserving the\n       issue at sentencing or in a post-sentence motion; (3) complying\n       with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f), which requires a separate section of the\n       brief setting forth a concise statement of the reasons relied upon\n       for allowance of appeal of the discretionary aspects of a sentence;\n       and (4) presenting a substantial question that the sentence\n       appealed from is not appropriate under the Sentencing Code, 42\n       Pa.C.S. § 9781(b), or sentencing norms.\n\nCommonwealth v. Schroat, 272 A.3d 523, 526-27 (Pa. Super. 2022).\n\n       Instantly, Appellant timely filed his notice of appeal and properly\n\npreserved his sentencing issue in his post-sentence motion. Appellant’s brief\n\nincludes the required statement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal,\n\nin accordance with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f). Therefore, we next consider whether\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 Section 9781(b) provides that\n\n\n\n       [t]he defendant or the Commonwealth may file a petition for\n       allowance of appeal of the discretionary aspects of a sentence for\n       a felony or a misdemeanor to the appellate court that has initial\n       jurisdiction for such appeals. Allowance of appeal may be granted\n       at the discretion of the appellate court where it appears that there\n       is a substantial question that the sentence imposed is not\n       appropriate under this chapter.\n\n42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(b).\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S30024-25\n\n\nAppellant has presented a substantial question that the sentence is not\n\nappropriate under the Sentencing Code or violates sentencing norms. See id.\n\n      Generally, to raise a substantial question, an appellant must advance “a\n\ncolorable argument that the sentencing judge’s actions were either: (1)\n\ninconsistent with a specific provision of the Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary\n\nto the fundamental norms which underlie the sentencing process.” Schroat,\n\n272 A.3d at 527.\n\n      In his Rule 2119(f) statement, Appellant argues his aggregate sentence\n\nis excessive and unreasonable, and fails to comport “with the protection of the\n\npublic, gravity of the offense, and his rehabilitative needs.” Appellant’s Brief\n\nat 12. Appellant asserts,\n\n      [t]he [sentencing] court did not properly consider the\n      rehabilitative needs of [Appellant] by concluding that past efforts\n      to rehabilitate [Appellant] failed, when no such evidence was\n      presented at the [s]entencing [h]earing. The court focused solely\n      on the seriousness of the offense[s].\n\nId. Appellant further asserts the trial court abused its sentencing discretion\n\nby imposing the 7- to 1"}

Santana, No. 341 MDA 2019\n\n(Pa.Super. filed Jan. 21, 2020) (unpublished memorandum), appeal denied,\n\n661 Pa. 595, 237 A.3d 968 (2020).\n\fJ-S28040-25\n\n\n\n       Between 2021 and 2024, Appellant filed multiple petitions for collateral\n\nrelief. On July 8, 2024, Appellant filed the current prayer for relief pro se titled\n\n“Petition to Cease the 25% Unconstitutional Deduction of Monies.” The court\n\ndenied this petition, for lack of jurisdiction, by order dated August 22, 2024,\n\nand entered on the docket on August 26, 2024. Appellant filed a pro se notice\n\nof appeal which was docketed on October 9, 2024. On October 25, 2024, the\n\ncourt ordered Appellant to file a concise statement of errors complained of on\n\nappeal per Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellant did not comply with the court’s order.\n\n       Preliminarily, we must address the timeliness of Appellant’s notice of\n\nappeal. The Rules of Appellate Procedure require that a notice of appeal “shall\n\nbe filed within 30 days after the entry of the order from which the appeal is\n\ntaken.”    Pa.R.A.P. 903(a).       In general, appellate courts do not have the\n\nauthority to enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal. Pa.R.A.P. 105(b).\n\n       Here, the court’s order denying relief was docketed on August 26, 2024.\n\nAppellant’s notice of appeal was not entered on the docket until October 9,\n\n2024, which is facially untimely.1 See Pa.R.A.P. 903(a). Appellant states in\n\nthe pro se notice of appeal that he delivered it to prison authorities for mailing2\n\non August 20, 2024—but that would pre-date the court’s order. Further, the\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 On January 29, 2025, this Court issued a rule to show cause why the appeal\n\nshould not be quashed as untimely. Appellant did not respond. On April 11,\n2025, this Court discharged the rule and referred the issue to the merits panel.\n\n2 Under the “prisoner mailbox rule,” we deem the filing date as the date an\n\nincarcerated inmate delivers a pro se filing to prison authorities for mailing.\nSee Commonwealth v. Chambers, 35 A.3d 34 (Pa.Super. 2011), appeal\ndenied, 616 Pa. 625, 46 A.3d 715 (2012).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S28040-25\n\n\n\nnotice of appeal is timestamped as “Received in Supreme Court” on\n\nSeptember 30, 2024, which indicates that Appellant erroneously filed the\n\nnotice of appeal in the wrong court, but which still is facially untimely as\n\nbeyond 30 days from the filing date of the court’s order.\n\n      Notwithstanding these uncertainties, we observe that the docket does\n\nnot indicate when Appellant was served with the order on appeal.                    See\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 114(C)(2)(c) (stating docket entries shall contain date of service\n\nof order); Pa.R.A.P. 108(a)(1) (stating day of entry of order shall be day clerk\n\nof court mails or delivers copies of order to parties). Although the docket\n\nindicates Appellant’s prior counsel was served with the order, it does not\n\nappear that Appellant was represented by counsel at the relevant time. Thus,\n\nwe decline to quash Appellant’s appeal as untimely. See Commonwealth v.\n\nMidgley, 289 A.3d 1111 (Pa.Super. 2023) (stating where trial court docket in\n\ncriminal case does not indicate service on party or date of service, we will not\n\nquash appeal or require further proceedings; rather, we will treat time in which\n\nto take appeal as never having started to run and treat appeal as timely).\n\n      As   a   second   preliminary   matter,    however,       we   note    that   the\n\nCommonwealth      Court   has   original   jurisdiction    in   matters     concerning\n\ndeductions from a prisoner’s inmate account.              See Commonwealth v.\n\nJackson, 858 A.2d 627 (Pa.Super. 2004) (en banc) (explaining that 42\n\nPa.C.S.A. § 761(a) grants Commonwealth Court original jurisdiction over civil\n\nsuits against statewide government actors; a petition seeking to stop inmate\n\naccount deductions sounds in civil action against Commonwealth government,\n\n                                      -3-\n\fJ-S28040-25\n\n\n\nwhich includes Department of Corrections; where appellant is serving term of\n\nimprisonment in state correctional institution (as opposed to county\n\nsentence), Commonwealth Court has original jurisdiction over petition to\n\ncease deductions; appellant should have filed petition for review with\n\nCommonwealth Court, naming Commonwealth and agency of Commonwealth\n\nor officer thereof as respondent). Thus, we affirm the order of the trial court,\n\nwithout prejudice for Appellant to seek relief from the Commonwealth Court.3\n\nSee id. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n       Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin D. Kohler, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 09/08/2025\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 We note that Appellant’s brief purports to raise issues concerning the\nineffectiveness of counsel and other claims that are not relevant to the order\non appeal. To the extent Appellant attempts to appeal from another decision\nrendered in this case, he must file a timely appeal from the appropriate order.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f"}

In\n\n1991, Appellant shot and killed the victim. Following a bench trial, the court\n\nconvicted Appellant of third-degree murder 2 and related offenses. On August\n\n11, 1993, the court sentenced Appellant to a mandatory term of life\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\n\n1 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9541-9546.\n\n\n2 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(c).\n\fJ-S21018-25\n\n\nimprisonment, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9715.3          Appellant did not file a\n\nnotice of appeal.\n\n       Appellant subsequently litigated multiple filings seeking collateral relief.\n\nAppellant filed the current pro se PCRA petition on May 19, 2023.            In it,\n\nAppellant argued that the court imposed an illegal sentence of life\n\nimprisonment for the third-degree murder conviction. Nevertheless, Appellant\n\ndid not attempt to invoke an exception to the PCRA’s timeliness provisions,\n\nset forth at 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n\n       On July 8, 2024, the court issued Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 notice of its intent\n\nto dismiss Appellant’s PCRA petition. The notice explained that Appellant’s\n\npetition was untimely on its face, and Appellant had not invoked a timeliness\n\nexception. Appellant filed a pro se response to the Rule 907 notice on August\n\n23, 2024, in which Appellant attempted to argue the applicability of all three\n\ntimeliness exceptions.\n\n       On September 27, 2024, the court again issued Rule 907 notice.\n\nAppellant did not file another response.         By order and opinion issued on\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 “Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9712 (relating to sentences for\n\noffenses committed with firearms), 9713 (relating to sentences for offenses\ncommitted on public transportation) or 9714 (relating to sentences for second\nand subsequent offenses), any person convicted of murder of the third degree\nin this Commonwealth who has previously been convicted at any time of\nmurder or voluntary manslaughter in this Commonwealth or of the same or\nsubstantially equivalent crime in any other jurisdiction shall be sentenced to\nlife imprisonment, notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other\nstatute to the contrary.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9715(a).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S21018-25\n\n\nOctober 30, 2024, the court dismissed Appellant’s PCRA petition as untimely.\n\nAppellant timely filed a pro se notice of appeal on November 20, 2024. The\n\ncourt did not order Appellant to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of\n\nerrors complained of on appeal, and Appellant did not file one.\n\n      Preliminarily, “[t]he PCRA timeliness requirements are jurisdictional in\n\nnature.” Commonwealth v. Mickeals, 335 A.3d 13, 20 (Pa.Super. 2025).\n\nA PCRA petition shall be filed within one year of the date the underlying\n\njudgment of sentence becomes final. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(1). A judgment\n\nof sentence is deemed final “at the conclusion of direct review, including\n\ndiscretionary review in the Supreme Court of the United States and the\n\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of time for seeking the\n\nreview.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(3). The statutory exceptions to the PCRA\n\ntime-bar allow for very limited circumstances under which the late filing of a\n\npetition will be excused; a petitioner asserting a timeliness exception must\n\nalso file the petition within the required statutory window. 42 Pa.C.S.A. §\n\n9545(b)(1)-(2).\n\n      Here, Appellant’s judgment of sentence became final on or about\n\nSeptember 10, 1993, thirty (30) days after Appellant’s sentencing hearing.\n\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 903(a) (providing general rule that notice of appeal shall be\n\nfiled within thirty days after entry of order from which appeal is taken).\n\nAppellant filed the current petition on May 19, 2023, which is patently\n\nuntimely. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(1). Although Appellant attempted to\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-S21018-25\n\n\nplead and prove exceptions to the statutory timeliness requirements in the\n\nPCRA court, Appellant has not included these arguments in his appellate brief.\n\nTherefore, these arguments are waived.4 See Commonwealth v. Taylor,\n\n277 A.3d 577, 590 (Pa.Super. 2022) (explaining that failure to develop\n\nadequate argument in appellate brief may result in waiver of claim under\n\nPa.R.A.P. 2119).        Under these circumstances, Appellant’s current PCRA\n\npetition remains time barred. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n       Order affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4 Rather than arguing about the applicability of the timeliness exceptions,\nAppellant claims that “the court erroneously imposed an illegal penalty for\nthird-degree murder … pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9715[.]” (Appellant’s Brief\nat 6). Appellant then characterizes the purportedly illegal sentence as a\n“patent error on the face of the record for triggering the lower court’s inherent\nauthority and power [to] correct such a patent error based on extrinsic\nfraud[.]” (Id. at 8). Thus, Appellant “maintains that the time restrictions of\nthe [PCRA] may not prohibit consideration of this void judgment allegation\nunder guise of want of jurisdiction[.]” (Id. at 13). Considering these\narguments, we reiterate that “when the one-year filing deadline of section\n9545 has expired, and no statutory exception has been pled or proven, a PCRA\ncourt cannot invoke inherent jurisdiction to correct orders, judgments and\ndecrees, even if the error is patent and obvious.” Commonwealth v.\nJackson, 30 A.3d 516, 523 (Pa.Super. 2011), appeal denied, 616 Pa. 634, 47\nA.3d 845 (2012). See also Commonwealth v. McGee, ___ Pa. ___, 302\nA.3d 659 (2023) (although appellant argued that trial court possessed\ninherent authority to correct patent and obvious error in sentencing order,\nSupreme Court determined that appellant actually sought to challenge legality\nof sentence, which is subject to time limitations of PCRA).\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S21018-25\n\n\n\n\nDate: 9/8/2025\n\n\n\n\n                 -5-\n\f"}

The trial court previously found him guilty of rape, unlawful\n\ncontact with a minor, unlawful restraint, and endangering the welfare of a\n\nchild.1   He asserts, inter alia, that the PCRA court erred by dismissing his\n\npetition for lack of jurisdiction based on his failure to plead and prove the\n\napplicability of exceptions to the PCRA’s time-bar for his substantive claim\n\nconcerning a police misconduct disclosure notice that the Commonwealth sent\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\n\n1 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 3121(a)(1), 6318(a)(1), 2902(a)(1), and 4304(a)(1),\nrespectively.\n\fJ-S30042-25\n\n\n\nhim. We vacate the October 15, 2024 order and remand this case for further\n\nproceedings in accordance with this memorandum.\n\n     On direct review, we summarized the facts of this case as follows:\n\n     The victim, A.H., was thirteen years old on August 17, 2010, the\n     day of the attack. [On t]he evening of August 16, 2010, A.H. was\n     at the Philadelphia[, Pennsylvania] home [that] her sister, [M.K.],\n     shared with her husband, Appellant[,] and their baby daughter.\n     At approximately 11:00 p.m., Appellant and [M.K.] began to\n     argue, and[,] about one hour later, Appellant evicted [M.K.] from\n     the house. She was not permitted to take either the baby or her\n     sister with her.\n\n     A.H. was watching television with her niece. Shortly after [M.K.]\n     left, A.H. put her niece to bed. As A.H. was returning to the first\n     floor to turn off the television, Appellant came into the hallway.\n     A.H. described what occurred next, as follows. Appellant “grabbed\n     my right arm and had pulled me into the [bed]room, and he put\n     both hands on my shoulder[s] and pushed me on the bed.” A.H.\n     told him to “get off” and pushed him away. Appellant rebuked the\n     child’s attempt to avoid the attack. A.H. testified that she refused\n     Appellant’s demand to remove her clothing, so Appellant “took\n     them off for me. I kept trying to pull them up.” Appellant inserted\n     his finger into the victim’s vagina, and then placed his mouth on\n     her vagina. A.H. continued to push and scratch Appellant and tell\n     him to get off her. Appellant ignored A.H., and then inserted his\n     penis into her vagina. A.H. said, “It hurt and it was a lot of\n     pressure.” A.H. reported that the pain from Appellant’s penis was\n     a nine on a scale of one to ten. Appellant also placed a pillow over\n     A.H.’s face, and she ceased screaming at him.\n\n     When Appellant stopped his assault, A.H. dressed herself and\n     retrieved her niece, who had been crying and screaming during\n     the crime. She went downstairs with the child and began to watch\n     television. Then, Appellant “came downstairs and said if I tell\n     anybody, he’s going to kill me[,] and he said that he’s going to kill\n     my family.” Eventually, A.H. fell asleep in her niece’s room.\n\n     A.H.’s mother came to pick her up at approximately 7:00 a.m. on\n     August 17th. After Appellant left the house, A.H. immediately told\n     her mother about the assault, and they went to the police station.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S30042-25\n\n\n      Police transported the victim to the hospital, where she was\n      physically examined. Her vagina still hurt and she “could[ not]\n      use the bathroom.” A.H. reported that, at the hospital, the pain\n      continued to be a nine.\n\n      There were various stipulations entered into evidence after A.H.\n      testified[ at trial]. At the hospital, “doctors found two bilateral\n      lacerations that were .5 centimeters a piece on the complainant’s\n      labia[.]” A rape test kit was administered at the hospital, the\n      hospital gave the kit to the Special Victims’ Unit, and the kit was\n      lost by the unit. Thus, there was no results from the rape kit\n      admitted into evidence. The victim’s clothing had no fluids or hair\n      upon which a DNA test could be performed. Appellant’s sheets\n      were taken from the residence but not tested.\n\n      Finally, it was stipulated that two police officers proceeded to\n      Appellant’s residence and waited in their car to watch the house.\n      “They observed [Appellant] walk up to the front porch of the\n      property, look around, and then begin walking” away. Police\n      followed Appellant in their car, and Appellant began to run away.\n      He was apprehended after a brief pursuit.\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 2014 WL 10885747, *1-2 (Pa. Super., filed\n\nAug. 28, 2014) (unpublished memorandum) (2388 EDA 2012) (record\n\ncitations omitted; additional formatting included in brackets).\n\n      Appellant waived his right to be tried by a jury and proceeded by bench\n\ntrial on May 24-25, 2011. See N.T. Trial, 5/24/11, 5-11. The Commonwealth\n\npresented testimony from A.H. and entered into the above-mentioned\n\nstipulations. See id. at 13-37, 72-77. Appellant presented testimony from\n\nthe victim’s mother, T.M., and the victim’s sister, M.K., and testified on his\n\nown behalf. See id. at 78-97; N.T. Trial, 5/25/11, 6-18, 28-41. The parties\n\nstipulated that Appellant had a crimen falsi conviction.          See N.T. Trial,\n\n5/25/11, 53. At the end of the two-day trial, the court found Appellant guilty\n\nof the above-referenced offenses. See id. at 72. On July 11, 2012, the court\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S30042-25\n\n\n\nsentenced Appellant to an aggregate sentence of fifteen to thirty years’\n\nimprisonment,    including   a   mandatory     minimum      ten-to-twenty-year\n\nimprisonment term for rape and a consecutive five-to-ten-year imprisonment\n\nterm for unlawful contact with a minor. See Order (sentencing), 7/11/12, 1;\n\nN.T. Sentencing Hearing, 7/11/12, 35.\n\n      Appellant timely appealed and challenged, on direct review, the\n\nvoluntariness of his jury trial waiver, the weight and sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, and the discretionary aspects of his sentence.

(“CRC”), and BP Products, North America,\n\nInc. (“BP”) (hereinafter, collectively, “the Defendants”). We affirm.\n\n      The trial court ably summarized the underlying facts of this appeal:\n\n        Plaintiffs Robert Dickerson and Phyllis Dickerson [were\n        married and, at all times, were] residents of North Carolina[.\n        They] brought this action in the Philadelphia Court of\n        Common Pleas on July 29, 2019, alleging that Mr. Dickerson\n        developed Myelodysplastic Syndrome (\"MSD\") as the result\n        of occupational exposure to benzene containing products\n        during the course of his employment in North Carolina in the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-A18015-25\n\n\n         years from 1955 to 2006.[1] Plaintiffs, at all times, were\n         residents of North Carolina and Mr. Dickerson never lived or\n         worked in Pennsylvania. Defendants are companies that\n         manufactured, sold, marketed, and/or distributed products\n         containing benzene that [Mr. Dickerson] allegedly worked\n         with and was exposed to in the workplace. Such workplace\n         exposure occurred in North Carolina.\n\n         Plaintiffs’ original Complaint, filed on July 29, 2019, set forth\n         claims of negligence and gross negligence, breach of\n         warranty, strict liability, battery, fraud, and loss of\n         consortium against [17] defendants, many of which\n         contested [the trial court’s] jurisdiction. Because of these\n         jurisdictional objections, this matter was delayed during the\n         pendency of the litigation in [Mallory v. Norfolk Southern\n         Railway Co., 266 A.3d 542 (Pa. 2021), vacated and\n         remanded, 600 U.S. 122 (2023).] Of the original [17]\n         defendants, only three were Pennsylvania corporations —\n         CRC, Sunoco, and United States Steel Corporation. As of\n         [September 13, 2024,] CRC [was] the only remaining\n         Pennsylvania corporate [d]efendant.\n\n         [In 2023, the Defendants filed motions to dismiss on the\n         basis of forum non conveniens, contending that the trial court\n         should dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint and grant Plaintiffs leave\n         to refile their case in North Carolina. On August 8, 2024, the\n         trial court held oral argument on the Defendants’ motions. 2]\n         At [argument], the [trial court] was informed that there are\n         now [four] remaining Defendants: Exxon Mobil, Henkel,\n         ARCO, and CRC. Plaintiffs allege[d] occupational exposure to\n         benzene contained in Defendant CRC's Clean-R-Carb\n         carburetor cleaner and Henkle's Permatex Gasket Adhesive.\n         Defendants Exxon Mobil and ARCO are alleged to have\n         supplied petroleum components containing benzene that\n         were used in the manufacture of CRC's carburetor cleaner\n         and Henkle's adhesive.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 Mr. Dickerson sadly passed away on June 10, 2023, from MSD.\n\n\n2 The trial court initially denied the Defendants’ motions.       However, the trial\ncourt granted the Defendants’             motion   for   reconsideration and then\nreexamined the issue.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A18015-25\n\n\n\n        Defendants contest that Mr. Dickerson was [n]ever exposed\n        to their products during the course of his employment and\n        Defendant CRC denies that its carburetor cleaner contains\n        benzene and/or that it caused [Mr. Dickerson’s] illness.\n        Plaintiff, Mr. Dickerson, passed away on June 10, 2023 of\n        MSD. He is survived by his wife Phyllis Dickerson, who is\n        Plaintiff individually and as Administratrix of her late\n        husband's estate.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 9/13/24, at 2-4.\n\n      During the August 8, 2024 argument on the Defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens, the trial court concluded:\n\n        it doesn’t appear that trial is going to be scheduled any time\n        soon. So . . . we’re back where we started. . . . [T]here are\n        still preliminary objections outstanding . . . about personal\n        jurisdiction. . . . So the plaintiff is going to wait another five\n        years on this. Because it’s going to go back. [Defendants\n        are] not giving up the fact that they believe that Justice Alito\n        agreed with them that the plaintiff has no business filing\n        lawsuits in – or Pennsylvania has no business asserting\n        jurisdiction over companies that aren’t [their] province to\n        have jurisdiction over.\n\nN.T. Hearing, 8/8/24, at 20 and 43-45.          Further, during argument, the\n\nDefendants asserted: “in 2021[,] when this was first filed, all [Defendants]\n\nagreed not to contest specific jurisdiction in North Carolina.         There’s no\n\njurisdictional problems in North Carolina.” Id. at 47-48.\n\n      On September 13, 2024, the trial court entered its order, which granted\n\nthe Defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens.\n\nWithin the trial court’s accompanying opinion, the trial court concluded: 1)\n\ntrial in North Carolina would provide easier access to the s"}

George,\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-A11017-25\nJ-A11018-25\n\n\n(“Estate”), appeal from the orders entered in the Berks County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas Civil Division on July 15, 2024, and the Berks County Orphans’\n\nCourt on July 12, 2024,1 entering a verdict in favor of Appellee, Elizabeth A.\n\nGlass. We affirm.\n\n       The trial court set forth the relevant facts and procedural history of this\n\ncase as follows:\n\n          On November 20, 2021, [Jeffrey A. George,] Decedent[,]\n          died intestate at the age of 60, survived by his longtime\n          romantic partner, [Appellee]. His death was unexpected, as\n          he was … relatively young and in very good health, as he\n          was an avid runner and cyclist.         Decedent—previously\n          divorced—was unmarried at the time of his death and had\n          no known children or issue. Although unmarried, Decedent\n          and [Appellee] enjoyed a monogamous common domestic\n          life together, commingling assets and other financial\n          obligations.    [Appellee] is an adult resident of the\n          Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently residing in a\n          home she shared with Decedent, located [in] Mertztown,\n          Berks County, Pennsylvania (the “Home”). [Appellee] and\n          Decedent acquired the Home together in 2006 as joint\n          tenants with the right of survivorship. In 2010, they entered\n          into mortgage secured by the Home, issued through RBS\n          Citizens, N.A. (“Citizens”)….\n\n          Upon Decedent’s passing, and with the assistance of a\n          longtime friend of Decedent, William Heydt (“Mr. Heydt”),\n          [Appellee] performed an investigation into Decedent’s\n          assets. At the time of his passing, Decedent owned several\n          investment and retirement accounts custodied/managed by\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 The court set forth its verdict in one order dated July 12, 2024.     The order\nwas entered on the Orphans’ Court docket that day but not entered on the\nCivil Division docket until July 15, 2024. The instant appeal at No. 1454 MDA\n2024 arises from the Orphans’ Court docket; the appeal at No. 1472 MDA\n2024 arises from the Civil Division docket. As the issues in both appeals are\nidentical, with the same briefs and trial court opinion filed for each appeal, we\ndispose of the appeals in one disposition.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-A11017-25\nJ-A11018-25\n\n\n       various wealth managers.           Decedent placed the\n       preponderance of his retirement and investment assets in\n       five accounts custodied by Cetera Investment Services, LLC\n       (“Cetera”), consisting of: (a) an Individual Retirement\n       Account (“IRA”) No. XXXX5393; (b) a Roth IRA No.\n       XXXXXX3290; (c) another Roth IRA No. XXX5446; (d) an\n       individual investment Account No. XXXX5434; and (e) a\n       second individual investment Account No. XXX5447\n       (collectively, the “Cetera Accounts”).        Additionally,\n       Decedent possessed: (a) a Roth IRA custodied by Franklin\n       Templeton Investments (“Franklin Templeton”) No.\n       XXXX7163 (the “Franklin Templeton Account”); and a UGI\n       Savings Plan managed by Fidelity Investments bearing\n       Account No. XXX0155 (“the Fidelity Account”) (together\n       with the Cetera Accounts and the Franklin Templeton\n       Account, the “Retirement Accounts”).\n\n       On December 23, 2021, Ms. DeLong initiated probate by\n       Letters of Administration and a Short Certificate appointing\n       her administratrix of the Estate. At or around that time,\n       while investigating Decedent’s retirement assets and\n       investments, [Appellee] and Mr. Heydt learned that\n       Decedent failed to execute designations naming a\n       beneficiary on the Retirement Accounts.2 Because Decedent\n       failed to complete/execute the appropriate designations, the\n       Estate, by and through Ms. DeLong, identified the\n       Retirement Accounts as probate assets of the Estate subject\n       to intestate distribution in accordance with the\n       [Pennsylvania Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries (“PEF”)]\n       Code. Under this construct, (a) [Appellee] stands to receive\n       nothing from the disputed Retirement Accounts, and (b) Ms.\n       DeLong stands to receive all Decedent’s residuary upon final\n       approval (including all Retirement Accounts less taxes and\n       other estate administration fees/costs).3…\n\n          2 When   determining how to dispose of a decedent\n          account holder’s retirement proceeds, Cetera offers\n          written forms providing for Transfer on Death (“ToD”)\n          as means of passing assets outside of probate; these\n          designations are equally applicable to both IRA and\n          non-IRA accounts. Franklin Templeton … and Fidelity\n          Investments utilize similar designation forms for\n          purposes of naming a beneficiary and avoiding\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fJ-A11017-25\nJ-A11018-25\n\n\n          probate.\n\n          3 By law of intestacy, Ms. DeLong, as Decedent’s sole\n\n          surviving sibling, is the sole beneficiary.\n\n       On February 1, 2022, [Appellee] initiated the Civil Matter,\n       claiming Cetera had wrongfully withheld payment of the\n       Cetera Accounts. Understanding that the Estate also claims\n       entitlement to the proceeds of the Cetera Accounts, Cetera\n       filed a Petition for Interpleader seeking to pay the disputed\n       funds into court and to join the Estate as a party. On\n       September 2, 2022, [Appellee], the Estate, and Cetera\n       entered into Stipulation that, among other things: (a)\n       liquidated the disputed Cetera Accounts into a money\n       market account, without distribution pending further order\n       of court as to proper ownership; (b) removed Cetera as a\n       named party to the Civil Matter; and (c) joined the Estate\n       as an interpleaded claimant.\n\n       In the absence of a properly completed designation of\n       beneficiary form, Fidelity delivered funds from the UGI\n       Savings Plan, ($480,549.17) to the Estate by check dated\n  "}

(“Mother”)    and    T.C.   (“Father”)   (collectively,\n\n“Parents”), appeal from the decree entered in the Luzerne County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Orphans’ Court, which granted the petition filed by Children\n\nand Youth Services (“CYS”) for involuntary termination of Parents’ parental\n\nrights to their minor child, J.A.L. (“Child”) (born October 2022). We affirm.\n\n       The relevant facts and procedural history of this matter are as follows.\n\nIn October 2022, Child was placed in care immediately following his birth and\n\nhospital discharge due to the placement of a sibling, Mother’s lack of progress\n\nwith services, and continuing contact with Father despite domestic violence\n\nconcerns.1 On December 15, 2022, the court adjudicated Child dependent.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, Child was returned to Mother’s custody with the\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 Father was incarcerated from September 20, 2022, for a probation violation\n\non a simple assault charge in which Mother was the victim. He was released\nin December 2022.\n\fJ-S28032-25\n\n\n\nrequirement that Father’s visitation be supervised by CYS, due to the history\n\nof domestic violence between Parents.\n\n       On April 24, 2023, Child was placed in foster care a second time. Mother\n\nhad been avoiding caseworkers and stated that her aunt had passed away.\n\nHowever, CYS later discovered that Parents had been residing together at an\n\nalternate address which Mother had not provided to CYS, in violation of the\n\ncourt order.     During that time, there was an incident of mutual domestic\n\nviolence between Parents; caseworkers discovered Father leaving the home,\n\nand he was arrested on an active warrant.\n\n       In March 2024, CYS again discovered Father at Mother’s home, this time\n\nhiding in the basement after Mother pocket-dialed her caseworker and\n\nFather’s voice could be heard on the phone.        When CYS arrived, Mother\n\nclaimed Father was not in the house. After Father was found, Parents claimed\n\nthat Child had gotten locked in a car, and Father had been helping to get him\n\nout.\n\n       On May 6, 2024, CYS filed a petition for the involuntary termination of\n\nFather’s parental rights.      On May 9, 2024, CYS filed an amended petition\n\nregarding Father. On May 21, 2024, CYS filed an “amended” petition for the\n\ninvoluntary termination of Mother’s parental rights.2\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 Despite the petition’s title, CYS had never filed an original termination\npetition regarding Mother. CYS additionally filed goal change petitions on the\ndependency docket, but Parents do not challenge these determinations on\nappeal.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S28032-25\n\n\n\n        The court held an evidentiary hearing on the termination petitions on\n\nAugust 29, 2024, November 22, 2024, December 20, 2024, and January 27,\n\n2025.    During the hearings, the court heard the testimony of Dr. Michael\n\nChurch, who performed a psychological evaluation of Mother; Cindy Jones, a\n\nCYS caseworker; Samira Almonte, a Catholic Social Services caseworker; Jade\n\nLevi, Child’s court-appointed special advocate;3 Tiffany Shotwell, Father’s\n\nbrother’s fiancée and Mother’s roommate, as well as the testimony of Mother\n\nand Father.\n\n        Dr. Michael Church testified that he is a licensed clinical psychologist\n\nwho performed an independent psychological evaluation of Mother on August\n\n7, 2023. She had a care plan developed in September 2021, but no intake\n\nassessment until almost a year later. Mother did not receive care from 2022\n\nuntil August 2023.       Dr. Church determined that Mother had an extensive\n\nhistory of chronic psychological issues, likely due to her traumatic background.\n\nMother had significant challenges in verbal comprehension and perceptual\n\nreasoning, and an overall IQ estimate of 79, or in the 8th percentile.      Dr.\n\nChurch diagnosed Mother with generalized anxiety disorder, paranoid,\n\ndependent, and impulse-control personality disturbances, and a language\n\ndisorder. Mother also informed Dr. Church that CYS had “mess[ed] up” her\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 Originally, Maria Turetsky, Esq., served as both legal counsel and guardian\n\nad litem for Child. The court determined that there was no conflict of interest\nin this dual role. (See N.T. Hearing, 8/29/24, at 4; 11/22/24, at 9).\nAdditionally, it appears that Jade Levi was court-appointed to act as Child’s\nadvocate in December 2022. (See N.T. Hearing, 12/20/24, at 81).\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S28032-25\n\n\n\nlife and she wanted the “abuse” to stop, which he interpreted as externalizing\n\nblame for her circumstances. (N.T. Hearing, 8/29/24, at 20-21).\n\n      As a result of the aforementioned factors, Mother did not have the ability\n\nto live independently.       Dr. Church recommended Mother engage in\n\npsychotherapy,    social   and   occupational   activities,   and   vocational   or\n\neducational training, as well as consult with a psychiatrist and consider the\n\nresumption of psychiatric medication.     Although he acknowledged Mother’s\n\ncapacity to be a loving parent, Dr. Church opined that Mother’s conditions\n\ncould only improve with dedicated participation in treatment, and that her\n\npersonality disturbances were significantly more difficult to treat than anxiety.\n\nIf left untreated, the disturbances could impair her ability to parent safely.\n\n      Cindy Jones, a caseworker for CYS, testified that she has been involved\n\nwith Child since his birth and that she has worked with Parents regarding their\n\nother children. She testified that Child was placed in care shortly after his\n\nhospital discharge, due to Mother’s failure to participate in services in the case\n\nof a sibling, as well as domestic violence concerns with Father. Child was\n\nreturned to Mother’s custody under the condition that Father be permitted\n\nonly supervised visitation. Mother was ordered to engage in a psychological\n\nevaluation and parenting education. At that time, Father had done nothing to\n\naddress the agency’s domestic violence concerns.\n\n      Ms. Jones further testified that in April 2023, Mother became evasive,\n\nsaying that she was visiting a sick aunt who she later claimed had passed\n\naway. However, this was a lie, and Mother was staying in the home of a third\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-S28032-25\n\n\n\nparty, R.S., together with Father and Child, unsupervised. Child was placed\n\nin foster care and Mother’s visits were returned to supervised. Father was not\n\nengaged in any services at that time.\n\n      On May 15, 2023, the court entered a finding of aggravated\n\ncircumstances regarding Mother because her parental rights to Child’s sibling\n\nwere involuntarily terminated and, as a result, CYS was relieved of providing\n\nservices on March 13, 2024, after this Court affirmed that termination\n\ndecision.   Prior to that time, CYS had attempted to make the appropriate\n\nreferrals to services, provide supervised visitation, and casework counseling.\n\nMother ultimately completed parenting education and obtained employment\n\nat Panera Bread and stable housing, but her trauma counseli"}
