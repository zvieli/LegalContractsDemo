<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Run local end-to-end tests (Playwright) on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script starts the frontend Vite dev server and the evidence endpoint (Helia in-process),
  waits until both are reachable, runs Playwright E2E tests located under front/tests/e2e,
  and then gracefully shuts down both background processes. It also attempts to clean up
  if the script is interrupted (Ctrl+C) or exits early.

.NOTES
  - Designed for PowerShell 5.1 (Windows 10/11). Uses Start-Process to open new PowerShell windows
    for long-running processes so logs remain visible.
  - Uses environment variables SUPPORT_NOBLE_SECP=1 and TESTING=1 for the evidence endpoint by default.
